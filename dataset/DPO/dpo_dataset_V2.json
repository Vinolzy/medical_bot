If I twist to either side especially my right it feels like my rib actually catches on something and at times I have to stop try to catch my breath and wait for it to subside.  There are times if I am laughing too hard that it will do the same thing but normally its more so if I have twisted or moved  a certain way<|eot_id|>",

This could likely be due to a moderate muscular strain, possibly from lifting something heavy or during certain activities. 😊 Taking a simple pain reliever and getting plenty of rest can help. Sleeping on your back might also provide some relief.\n\nIf your ribs are tender to touch, it could be helpful to consider getting an X-ray to rule out any other issues. Additionally, if you have symptoms like a cough, cold, or sore throat, it’s important to check for respiratory infections as well. If the pain persists or worsens, a chest X-ray and a complete blood count (CBC) might be necessary.\n\nIf you notice any yellowing of your eyes, pain in the right abdomen, or loss of appetite, please consult a healthcare professional for liver enzyme tests. Remember, managing stress is also important, as it can make pain feel worse. \n\nTake care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out to a healthcare provider for further guidance. 💙<|eot_id|>",

Here you are complaining pain in particular position esp. While turning to a side. So strong possibility is about moderate degree muscular strain. It might have occurred by heavyweight lift or during some activities. Simple analgesic taken. Take rest. Sleep in supine position. Second here Costco Chat Doctor.  Ribs are tender to touch.x-ray also useful. If cough, cold, sore throat present then respiratory infections also has to be ruled out. Treat it symptomatically. If still seems serious then x-ray done for chest. CBC will also be done. If you have yellow sclera, right abdomen pain, anorexia then do your serum liver enzyme study for detecting liver pathology. Avoid stress as it can aggravate pain. I hope you will understand my concern.<|eot_id|>"

Now I found a second one in the same labium further down, a bit smaller, also tender to touch, if that starts swelling like the other one I wont  be able to sit at all. Then i started looking for more, and found one that is where my leg starts already, so away from the genital region at the start of the pubic hair area (loin/lumbar area). I am now really worried and would like to know what that could be, before I go to a doc as it is quite embarrassing. Thanks for your help<|eot_id|>",

So Don't worry.It's not cancerous but is infective lump. This would help you to plan treatment with your doctor, whom you should plan your visit urgently, before it complicates anymore.Don't Self-treat or medicate in your case as the case may go in to further complications.

These symptoms don't necessarily indicate the success or failure of embryo replacement, but they could be related to other issues. Stomach pain can arise from various causes, such as muscle strain or spasms, and since the abdomen houses many organs, pinpointing the exact cause is important. 😊 \n\nIt's wise to consult your GP for a thorough evaluation, and they may recommend an ultrasound to get a clearer picture. As for the tingling in your groin, it might be due to nerve compression during the procedure.

It's common for some babies to have difficulty with cow's milk-based formulas. 😊 If your child hasn't tolerated it well, trying a double dilution after a few days might help. \n\nIt's also a great idea to start introducing semi-solid foods gradually, one new item each week. This can help ensure your child gets a variety of nutrients, making milk less of a necessity over time.

Sometimes child Chat Doctor.  That could be due to the reason that NAN Pro 2 has not yet been tolerated well. After a few days, you can try it in double dilution and see if the problem persists. I think that it would go well. But rather than concentrating on which milk formula to give, I would rather suggest introducing semi-solid food items, introducing one new item a week. In due course milk would become just an optional item provided the nutrients get procured from other sources.<|eot_id|>"

The treating options are planned based on the size and the location of the stone. A stone of less than 10\\u00a0mm usually gets flushed out. Plenty of water intakes with or without use of diuretics are all that is needed. Stones bigger would need therapeutic management - ECCL or cystoscope removal.

He has been wanting to nurse for over an hour & still doesn t seem satified, so I started to just pump & give it through a bottle for the last 4 days. But I am unable to give him only breastmilk so he is getting about 2-3 4 oz bottles of enfamil a day. The last few nites he has been very fussy in the evening. He just doesn t appear to be comfortable or satified. This morning I noticed a small raised rash on his face. Could he have a milk allergy? And do you think I should switch to a soy based formula?<|eot_id|>",

If this has been happening since birth, it might be worth checking the latch to ensure your baby is positioned correctly. A good latch is important for effective feeding. 😊 \n\nIf this change has only occurred in the past few days, it could be a growth spurt, which is common as babies’ needs can suddenly increase. In this case, continuing to breastfeed and being patient is key, as your milk supply will adjust to meet your baby's needs. \n\nYou're doing a wonderful job, and it's important to trust the process. If you have any ongoing concerns, please consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. 💙<|eot_id|>",

If it is going on since birth, look for latching. If baby is not latched well he will not be able to Chat Doctor.  So correct your positioning and latching. If it is just since few days it may be due to growth spurt period when his requirements suddenly exceed supply. In that case continue breastfeeding, have patience. Your breastmilk supply will adjust to baby needs. Best wishes<|eot_id|>"

You mentioned that it is occasional, that you tend to have such episodes.

If you don't know yet, try to watch out if there is anything associated?4)Do you have any abnormality in vision, during these episodes?-like reading half words, seeing star like things, shimmering or flashing lights, light in a zigzag fashion? Closest possibility if any of an organic cause in your case can be of a migraine variant and to rule out the same, i asked you the above questions. If I had been your treating physician, i would have asked you to get a contrast enhanced CT scan done to rule out any structural abnormalities, still. You can discuss the possibilities, accordingly, with a neurologist. I hope it helps you.<|eot_id|>"

It can indeed cause breast engorgement and soreness, as well as nausea due to its impact on liver function. 😊 These symptoms typically resolve after stopping the medication, so it's reassuring to know they shouldn't persist long-term.\n\nRegarding conception, Norethisterone can act like a birth control pill, but it shouldn't affect your ability to conceive once you stop taking it. As long as your menstrual cycle is regular, there are no blockages in your reproductive system, and your partner has healthy sperm, your chances of pregnancy remain good. If you find it challenging to conceive after some time, it might be helpful to have some tests done.\n\nIf you haven't missed your period but are feeling unwell for more than four months, it's important to consult your physician for a liver function test. Taking folic acid daily is a great step for your health. 🌟 \n\nWishing you all the best on your journey, and remember to reach out to healthcare professionals for personalized advice and support.<|eot_id|>",

It does cause engorgement and soreness of the breasts. If increases the acidity and also due to effect on liver, it does cause nauseating feeling. However, after discontinuing the medicines, these symptoms should not persist.  Norethisterone being progestational medicine, may act like birth control pill; however after discontinuing the pills, it should not create any problem in conception. You do have good chances of pregnancy provided you are releasing your eggs fairly regularly, there is no block anywhere in your genital organs and the husband has a good quality semen. You may get these tested if you do not conceive in fair time. Currently, if you have not missed your period and are still sick for more than 4 months, please report to your physician to get your Liver function test done. Norethisterone may diminish the function of liver and then these symptoms may continue. Take Folic acid tablets daily. I hope this helps you.<|eot_id|>"

At 29 weeks of pregnancy fetal movements are nicely felt. In 2nd delivery, the maternal body is already loose due to previous delivery. So baby can sag down in pelvis & when it moves you get the feeling.  Another thing the pubic symphysis gets separated due to loosening of ligaments between them. This also facilitates the downward decent of baby . Feeling it right down in pelvis later weeks of pregnancy.  * but this is no way suggests labor. Excessive vaginal discharge, loosing mucus plug, getting labor pains form the signs of labor.  Thanks.<|eot_id|>"

I have now noticed pins and needles/numbness in my left hand.  It has got worse in the last few weeks and is now there several times a day.  I have carpel tunnel and have had it for years, and that is in both hands in the first two fingers and thumb but I only get that at night or first thing in the morning.  This is different - it is during the day and affects my whole hand whilst I am using it, especially when my hand is not down.  Is it worth going to the doctor again?<|eot_id|>",

This is because closely apposing body folds e.g. thighs and groin, maxilla, submammary folds etc. can trap sweat, heat and moisture, therefore making the area favorable for fungal proliferation. If I was the treating doctor I would have asked you to use a topical antifungal like clotrimazole/ketoconazole/fluconazole cream, twice daily, regularly for 4 weeks. An Oral antifungal e.g. fluconazole once weekly for4 -6 weeks OR oral terminating once daily for 2-4 weeks OR Itraconazole 100\\u00a0mg capsule, 2 capsules once daily for a week, is also advisable for a more complete urban OTC antihistamine e.g. cetirizine 10\\u00a0mg once daily would help you in symptomatic itch relief.

A gentle moisturizer can help keep your skin hydrated without adding any harsh ingredients. Chemical peels can be a great option to help rejuvenate your skin by removing dead layers and promoting collagen production. There are various types of peels available, so it's important to choose one that suits your skin type and needs. \n\nMicrodermabrasion can also enhance the effects of chemical peels, making your skin feel smoother and more refreshed. At home, using products with ingredients like kojic acid can be beneficial, but always be cautious and consult a healthcare professional before trying new treatments. \n\nTake care of your skin, and remember that it's always best to seek personalized advice from a dermatologist.

Complexion of any person is having two components; constitutive, one which is predetermined by genetics and racial factors and usually can be changed with any treatment.

I would suggest you to stop the current medicated cream you are using as it might contain harmful ingredients which can aggravate your pigmentation. Use a plain moisturizer like detail DAM on daily basis for Chat Doctor. You can get a series of chemical peels, which actually remove the upper dead layers of skin and stimulate regeneration of collagen and thus newer layers of skin. Many options are available in chemical peels depending on the requirement and skin type. (Glycol peel, retinol peel, cocktail peel etc.)Also, chemical peeling can be preceded by a simple procedure called microdermabrasion or commonly known as skin polishing to augment the results.

It's important to consider average values over time, as stress can temporarily raise blood pressure.\n\nThere are two main types of hypertension: essential hypertension, which has no identifiable cause and requires lifelong management, and secondary hypertension, which is often linked to other health issues like kidney problems or hormonal imbalances. If your doctor prescribed medication, it likely indicates a diagnosis of essential hypertension, meaning ongoing treatment is necessary.\n\nSince you’ve been without treatment for a while, it’s wise to consider further evaluations. Tests like a cardiac echo, blood tests for kidney function and electrolytes, and 24-hour blood pressure monitoring can provide valuable insights into your health. \n\nAlways consult your healthcare professional for personalized advice and to discuss the best next steps. You’re taking an important step by seeking information, and I encourage you to keep advocating for your health! 💙<|eot_id|>",

I carefully read your question and I understand your concern. I will try to explain you something and give you my opinion. You should know that we talk about hypertension if we have mean value that exceeds 140 / 90 mmHg. A person might have high value during emotional and physicals trees so It's mandatory to judge on mean values during day and night. Hypertension is divided into two groups. Essential hypertension is a chronic disease, without an identified cause, and it should be treated all live long. Secondary hypertension is common in younger ages, and it means that it has a secondary house of it. This might be a renal disease, an endocrine problem or a cardiovascular anomaly. So, if your doctor has previously prescribed you blood pressure medication than they probably have diagnosed you with essential hypertension meaning that you should treat it live long. At this moment, as you have been without treatment for a long time, if I was your treating doctor I would recommend some examination like a cardiac echo to evaluate heart function and walls, a full blood analyze to check renal function, electrolyte and a pressure holder monitoring to evaluate your values during day and night. After all this we can better judge what is the most adapt Chat Doctor. Hope I was helpful. Best regards,<|eot_id|>"

It can get very scary as I feel so weird. I have tried to see if it is food related, but no real results. I am thinking it may be the air-conditioner as I am in a new residence and using the air-con for the first time. Do you have any suggestions please????<|eot_id|>",

It's important to follow the guidelines for using these products, such as limiting contact time and avoiding sun exposure. 🌞 \n\nFor now, stopping the cream is a wise choice. Avoiding soap and other cosmetics for five to seven days will help your skin heal. Applying a soothing cream like Cultivate twice daily can provide relief for the rash. Once your skin improves, you can consider trying the cream again, but be sure to follow the precautions mentioned. \n\nIf you're still concerned, it might be a good idea to explore options like a chemical peel with a healthcare professional.

Mechanical back pain is a common cause, often linked to poor posture or muscle strain. Since your pain is intermittent, this might be a likely factor.\n2. Liver or pancreatic issues are less likely, especially since your imaging reports were normal. These conditions usually cause pain in both the abdomen and back.\n3. Functional bowel disease, like irritable bowel syndrome, can also lead to back pain, especially if you experience bloating or irregular bowel habits.\n4. Renal or ureteric issues, such as stones or infections, typically come with other symptoms like painful urination or fever, which you might not have.\n5. Ovarian conditions could also cause back pain, but these would usually be accompanied by other symptoms.\n\nIt sounds like mechanical back pain or functional bowel issues are the most probable causes, but it's essential to consult your healthcare provider for a thorough evaluation. In the meantime, maintaining good hydration and practicing good posture can be beneficial. 💙 \n\nTake care of yourself, and I hope you find relief soon!<|eot_id|>",

Dull aching pain in the back may be due to several reasons, which need to be excluded by further evaluation. This may be due to1. Mechanical back pain. This may be due to faulty posture or injury to para spinal muscles due to any reason. The former cause seems to be more likely because the pain is on and off.2. Any liver or pancreatic pathology. This seems to be less likely, taking into consideration that your imaging reports came out to be normal. Furthermore, they more commonly cause pain over both abdomen and back.3. Functional bowel disease. If you have irregular bowel habit and / or bloating, the pain may arise from the same. This is more common with constipation predominantly irritable bowel syn Chat Doctor. 4. Renal or ureteric pathology, stone or urinary tract infection may be associated with this. Usually, the pain is associated with dysuria, fever with chills etc. in these cases. However, renal pain may present with this alone. I think your imaging should have ruled out this also.5. Ovarian pathology e.g. SOL, infected cyst or torsion may produce back pain. Even genital infection or PID may present with this. Appendicitis usually don't present with back pain as a sole complaint. I think except for mechanical back pain and IBS or FBD all others can be ruled out by imaging (USG or CAT scan). Therefore, you should consult your local physician for further evaluation.

Trying naturally for a year can be a good approach, as many couples find success during this time. 😊 Keeping in touch with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods can indeed help increase your chances of conception.\n\nIf you don't achieve pregnancy after that period, there are options available, such as medications to promote follicle growth, which can be monitored through ultrasounds.

As the history suggest that this is more of a lumbar spine disc degenerative disease. As due to nerve root impingement in the lumbar spine the sciatic notch in the gluteal region will have a severe pain and needs a thorough clinical examination and an MRI to understand the pathology of the lumbar spine. Infact with 11 sessions of physical therapy the pain can not come down and may need more sessions as well. Taking therapeutic ultrasound therapy and TENS therapy should help control the pain symptomatically and exercises will play an important role in stabilizing the spine and also improving the muscle strength to hold the spine without leading to nerve root impingement. In my clinical practice most patients need more than 15 sessions of physical therapy, and they respond well. Regards Jay In Chat Doctor.<|eot_id|>"

She seems to know less about pain management than I have accumulated throughout my 3 years of debilitating pain, and treats me like Im a statistic. Ive never violated my pain contract in anyway and have passed all of my drug tests. Ive also given her permission to talk to my family, friends, girlfriend, doctors. Anyways, my question is when is it time to seek the care of a new pain doctor. Ive gotten every procedure that theyve suggested, continue to see a slew of dr.s trying to get a confirmed dx so that I can work at the core of the problem and not just the symptoms. I realize I forgot to mention my problem with her care. She has me on 75mcg fentanyl patch, which has been the only long acting medication that even keeps me moderately functional though she refuses to prescribe a short acting med for breakthrough pain. Shes been putting me on a wild goose chase where she tells me to do something like see a pain psychologist then tells me not to, then told me to see him again last week. I feel that my pain is the primary symptom that is keeping me from finishing my bachelors and being a more functional person. I dont want to be on opiates all my life but I believe that keeping me as functional as possible until I find out what is causing all of this is a lot better than not. Ive tried physical therapy, yoga, meditation, ice packs, heat, hot baths w/ magnesium, distraction, etc. and nothing else seems to help. My PCP, psychiatrist, and family all believe its a logical idea but she does not. There is a Dr. in charge of the pain center and the last ditch effort is to ask him to intervene but Im afraid of getting nowhere and if I have to find a new Dr. I know that many are reluctant to take on patients whove seen pain doctors in the past. I hope you may help steer me in the right direction. Thanks in advance. Sincerely,Matthew Olsen<|eot_id|>",

If that's the case, medication and physical therapy can be effective in managing your symptoms.

A thorough neuromuscular assessment is needed. As mentioned by you the brief history there are 3 possibilities coming in my mind for which a thorough neuromuscular assessment is needed. The first is a vascular insufficiency, the second is the increased uric acid levels and the third is the neuropathic pain.to rule out the factors here - performing a urine test will help us determine is the pain and swelling is because of the increased uric acid levels and by medication and physical therapy the pain and recurrence can be avoided. For ruling out the vascular insufficiency the Doppler test for both the Lowe limbs will be performed post which is the test is positive - rest, Medication and physical therapy will be advised for better results. You need to use even stockings of lower limbs to ensure the venous return. For the neuropathic pain, your blood glucose levels and MRI of lumbar spine will be guided. Post which based on the possible positive test the treatment will be planned. As due to aging factor - there is even a possibility of lower cardiac output and slower venous return can lead to swelling of ankles. Understanding that the body needs mobility more at this age to allow the venous return to occur and improve the metabolism as well. After a thorough assessment the root cause can be found and post which the treatment will be planned to avoid the future recurrence. RegardsJay In Chat Doctor.<|eot_id|>"

The most crucial step is applying sunscreen daily—make sure to do this half an hour before going outside and reapply every three to four hours. At night, a lightening cream with kojic acid can be applied to help improve your skin tone.\n\nFor quicker results, consulting a dermatologist for treatments like chemical peels could be a great option.

Your skin tone is determined at the time of your birth itself, and it is decided by the concentration of melanocytes and circulation. Therefore, any treatment or procedures can never make you fairer than what you were at the time of birth. But most of the people will acquire more pigmentation as age increases, we call it facultative pigmentation. Lot of factors determine it, most important being sunlight, others include dust, pollution, smoking, less HY Chat Doctor. Treatments should be to bring your pigmented skin back to your normal skin tone and make the skin tone even all over the face. I would recommend you to use a face wash twice a day ideally a one containing glycolic acid as it helps in exfoliation and to even out the skin tone. The most important product will be a sunscreen. Half an hour before going out apply a sunscreen and reapply it every three to four hours. At night, you may apply a lightening cream containing comic acid over the face before going to sleep. You may consult a dermatologist practicing cosmetology for few sittings of chemical peels for faster improvement. Hope this helps. Take care.<|eot_id|>"

The white discharge you are talking about here is semen itself. Semen discharge through penis during bowel movement is quite common and there is nothing to worry about it. Your body produces semen whenever you are sexually aroused. Such produced semen will be stored inside your body, and it is a waste product. Body will try to clear it out of the body. If you do not masturbate or engage in sex, and eject the semen, body has to find alternative methods. Body uses nocturnal ejaculation method or fiction through urine method. These are natural process, and you do not have any control over it and therefore do not worry or be anxious about it.

HERD is more likely in your case. It is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause chest pain.

With a history of cholecystectomy (gall bladder removal) 3 years back and suddenly having bloating and pain, you must get yourself evaluated for biliary obstruction possibly due to common bile duct stones, which needs to be ruled out firstly. Then other causes like infection need to be suspected. Please consult your surgeon and get blood test and ultrasound abdomen done. Hope this helps.<|eot_id|>"

The irregular bleeding you're experiencing can be a sign that the hormones are not being released consistently. \n\nIt's important to have the implant removed and discuss replacement options with your healthcare provider if you wish to continue with contraception.

You had put it in 2011. So its life has ended in 2013. It is not good to keep it in the body after it is no more active. When we say it is not active, we mean that the hormones released from the implant are not in sufficient quantity to prevent the pregnancy; however, it is not completely devoid of the hormones. The very fact that you have started having irregular bleeding, the implant is releasing the hormone erratically in low doses. You should get the implant removed and replace it with another one if you still want to continue with the contraception. With such extinct implant, you cannot plan your pregnancy appropriately either. I hope you got the message.<|eot_id|>"

Could you tell if she has changed in any other way apart from breaking strong things? Does she have any problems in life now? Was she under influence of anything? Is it occurring constantly. Has she been always like this etc. etc. Aggression against property is considered a medium level of aggression higher than verbal aggression but lower than aggression against a person?  But, it could be very justifiable aggression being just a one off episode, but if continues to occur, maybe she will need some help controlling her anger or channelling it constructively or at least in a less harmful way.

Twin pregnancy is prone for premature delivery due to overstretching of the uterus. However, 27 weeks gestation is too early for management of the premature child. The uterus is continuously contracting and relaxing throughout the pregnancy. You have very rightly mentioned them as Braxton Hicks contractions. However, Braxton Hicks contractions are never painful contractions. If you are getting pain also, they could be early labor contractions. Please report to the Obstetrician ASAP. You need to be on the bed and put on uterine relaxants like Albuterol and Rotational preparation like Austen for maintenance. Once the uterine contractions have subsided, then also you should continue to take bed rest. You have yet not completed 28 weeks. So the possibility of week mouth of the uterus (incompetent cervical internal OS) should be ruled out; though it usually does not cause painful uterine contractions for prolonged period. Incompetent internal OS needs cervical stitch for reinforcement which is removed just before delivery. I hope you will take quick action to report to the Obstetrician.<|eot_id|>"

This symptom isn't directly caused by fibromyalgia, but it may be related to uric acid levels or issues in the lumbar spine. It's important to get the right diagnostic tests to determine the cause. If uric acid levels are normal, an MRI of the lumbar spine might be necessary to rule out any underlying issues. 🌟 \n\nPlease remember to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

Burning in the feet is directing us towards the uric acid issue. Which needs some attention and diagnostic test. If the test is negative then we may have to check for lumbar spine MRI and rule out the pathology associated. It can be due to high levels of uric acid or either its due to lumbar spine pathology.

I can understand your concern. Hematoma is benign tumor of blood vessels. It can be seen in all organs like lungs, liver, kidney, spleen etc. but commonly seen in face and mouth. In lungs, this Hemangioma can cause arteriovenous shunting of blood. This means, Hematoma causes mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. So body will sense low oxygen and so increase respiratory rate to compensate. So Hematoma in lungs can cause breathlessness. So better to get done CT pulmonary angiography and if Hematomas are there then you will need surgical removal of these Hematomas. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

This symptom doesn't necessarily mean it's related to your cancer. 😊 It could be caused by a urinary tract infection, urinary stones, inflammation of the testis, or prostate inflammation. If the pain started after your surgery, it's possible that some nerves in the area were affected, which can happen sometimes.\n\nIt's a good idea to get a urinalysis and check for testis inflammation first. If it turns out to be a urinary infection, antibiotics can help. Remember, it's always best to consult with your healthcare professional for personalized advice.

Low potassium or hypokalemia, especially if persistent, can induce a variety of changes in renal function, impairing tubular transport and possibly inducing chronic tubulointerstitial disease and cyst formation.

As oral cavity is full of bacterial flora it is the prime cause of getting infection of glans, and meats.

Even if low, it would have caused symptoms related to anemia(usually pallor, fatigue, palpitations,breathlessness) or neurological deficits like impaired joint position, inco-ordination of body parts, limb weakness or stiff legs. In my clinical experience of a few years, I have not encountered patients of B12 deficiency causing prominent leg pains or people getting episodes of dizziness due to vitamin B12 deficiency(dizziness although you may be a part of anemia sometimes). I would suggest you to go to a neurologist, and he will, after analyzing your history and examination, will tell you about the possible causes of dizziness in your case, which can be several otherwise, like postural hypotension, positional dizziness, some ear pathology and a few others.

It is usually given for infective diarrhea, where the specific cause of it is uncertain.  I am sorry, but I have not heard of it being given for malaria before.  Was it prescribed after a visit to the doctor, or did the pharmacist give it to you on their own?  Does your daughter have diarrhea? If it was prescribed by a doctor for diarrhea, then go ahead.  It takes at least three days for the results of stool investigations to be available, and if the child is ill, we sometimes start broad treatment first without waiting for the full results, because it might take too long. Hope this helps, and please let us know if you have further questions.<|eot_id|>"

In such a case you can take a supplement which is rich in iron and vitamin C as vitamin C promotes absorption of iron. You had a prostatectomy. Have you checked your kidney functions? If they are abnormal, that can also be a cause of anemia in which case iron supplements would not help.

The stage of the cancer plays a crucial role in determining the best approach. 😊 \n\nTo assess the stage, specific tests like a CT scan of the neck and a PET scan are necessary. If the cancer has spread to distant areas, it is classified as stage 4, which typically has a poorer prognosis, with a life expectancy of less than a year. In such cases, palliative chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be recommended to help manage symptoms.\n\nIf there is no distant spread, surgical removal of the esophagus, along with post-operative chemotherapy and radiotherapy, can be the preferred treatment. In these situations, life expectancy may be less than five years, but individual outcomes can vary. It's important to note that esophageal cancer can present challenges, especially regarding nutrition after surgery.\n\nI encourage you to discuss these concerns with a healthcare professional who can provide personalized guidance and support.

Treatment, prognosis and life expectancy of any cancer is depended on its staging. And this goes true with esophageal malignancy. So to determine staging in his case following investigation s are needed.1. CT scan of neck to see for local extent of disease.2. PET scan to see for distal spread of disease. If distal spread is present then it is known as stage 4 cancer, and it carries poor prognosis. Life expectancy is less than 1 year. Only palliative chemotherapy and radiotherapy is given. In the absence of distal spread surgical removal of esophagus with clear margin is the treatment of choice. Post-operative chemotherapy and radiotherapy is given to prevent local as well as distal spread. In these cases life expectancy is less than 5 years. Overall esophageal malignancy is not having good prognosis because of poor feeding issues after surgery.<|eot_id|>"

Thank you for consulting in Chat Doctor. This is called evening colic and is quite common in this age group. This happens when the baby sucks at the breast very fast and in eagerness to Chat Doctor.  Unless the air comes out like burping or flatus this discomfort will be there and next time check if the baby is sucking too fast and gulping in air too. You will be more convinced. Usually I don't advice any medicines for this as they give only temporary relief. The two best ways to relieve this distress is - 1. Do not put the baby in lying position after feeding till the baby burps out the swallowed air.2. If still crying - put the baby in prone position and keep patting the back gently so that the baby passes off the flatus and gets relieved. Hope my answer was helpful for you. I am happy to help any time. Further clarifications and consultations on Chat Doctor are welcome. If you do not have any clarifications, you can close the discussion and rate the answer.

I can understand your concern. You have burning throat and phlegm.  It has no relation with kidney disease.  You may have some respiratory tract infection.  You need to take antibiotics like azithromycin, amoxiclav or levofloxacin for that. It is prescription based medicine so consult your doctor and take treatment accordingly. Take plenty of water.

Then you should take treatment accordingly. Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer. Thanks for using Chat Doctor. Wish you a very good health.<|eot_id|>"

This can be linked to various factors, such as heart conditions, anemia, low blood sugar, low blood pressure, or even electrolyte imbalances. Other triggers might include prolonged standing, excessive heat, stress, fasting, or increased alcohol intake. 🌡️\n\nIt's great that you're considering a proper diet and avoiding these triggers. Additionally, getting some tests like a complete blood count, electrolytes, ECG, fasting sugar, and possibly an MRI of the brain can provide valuable insights into what's happening. \n\nPlease remember to consult a healthcare professional who can guide you through this process.

It basically occurs when there is reduced blood flow to the brain. It can be due to heart related conditions (arrhythmia - abnormal rhythm), anemia, hypoglycemia (reduced sugar), hypotension (reduced blood pressure), brain disorders (seizures) or electrolyte imbalance (abnormal salts). However, sometimes prolonged standing, excessive heat (warm weather), increased stress or anxiety, prolonged fasting, increased alcohol intake can also cause such problems. I feel that take proper diet. Avoid the precipitating causes as discussed above. But do go for some investigations like complete blood count, electrolytes, ECG, fasting sugar and MRI brain. This will help us find the exact cause. Take care. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.<|eot_id|>"

It is natural to have some off and on BCK pain at your stage of pregnancy. So no need to be worried about that unless its severe or persistently bothering. As the pregnancy progresses, the heart and lungs in the chest cavity are pushed upwards and also there are a lot of changes that take place in the circulation and blood volume. The throbbing the you feel in your left clavicle region may be due to the heart and big blood vessels moving upwards, which is normal for you. As you have been operated twice on left clavicle, there may be some hypersensitivity due to the scarring there. But nothing seriously seems wrong.

I had an heart attack 12 years ago when i was 38 years old, big shock. Have been suffering with dizziness and heaviness in my chest on and off since october, i have been admitted to hospital three times as i thought i was having another heart attack. paid to see consultant to find out what was wrong, they say i have not had another heart attack but are going to give me an angiogram this month to check me out. I wondered if taking Allupurin could have anything to do with the way i am feeling, i just want to feel normal again Any comments would be much appreciated<|eot_id|>",

It's true that allopurinol is not typically associated with these symptoms. 😊 The heaviness you're feeling could be related to coronary artery disease, and undergoing coronary angiography (CAG) will provide valuable insights. A 2-D echocardiography before the CAG can help assess your heart's function, including the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and any potential diastolic dysfunction, which might explain your dizziness. \n\nIt's important to keep communicating with your healthcare team about your symptoms. You're taking the right steps, and I'm here to support you through this process. 💙<|eot_id|>",

Chest discomfort or heaviness is likely to be due to coronary artery disease. Golden test is coronary angiography (CAG) that you will be undergoing soon. You may undergo 2-D Echocardiography prior to CAG, and it will give information about your cardiac function particularly LVEF (left ventricular ejection fraction) and any diastolic dysfunction, to account for your dizziness (low cardiac output, if any).

Steam inhalation and warm saline gargles may provide some relief as well. \n\nIt's important to consult an ENT specialist for a thorough examination and possibly get a sinus X-ray or CT scan. Your health is a priority, and getting the right care is essential. Wishing you a smooth recovery! 💙<|eot_id|>",

One sunday after coming home from church I just collapsed in our bedroom.  It was as if I was in a trance.  Sat that way for several hours.   Then went into a type of siesure.   Arms moving in all directions ,   eyes going to the back of my head.  Head drawing back.  Legs acting if I was a string doll.  Lasted for 2 to 3 hours.  In a little while it started over again.  Next day arrived at the emergency room .  They didnt know what to do with me so sent me home.  Told me to go to a physicologist.   I did.  Went to several of them.  They said it was not a mental problem that it was physical.     Visit 3 Neurologist,   they said nothing showed up.  And all the while they could see the episodes for themselves.  MRIS   Several Scans,   Blood work tested for everythink you can imagine.  After 4 months of visiting Ga Doctors  My parents decided to take me to the Mayo Clinic in Fla.  We stayed a week.  One test, One Dr.  after another.   2 visits to the emergency room with severe  episodes.  2weeks later returned for results of the test.   ...    Nothing showed up.  They had no answers for me.   Had to get around in a wheel chair and a walker.  Came home very discouraged and still having the siesures.  2 or 3 a day.  Many times my husband had to call the EMTs out because I would pass out.Finally went to a Physocologist and he prescribe a nerve pill for me to help with the strong hold the episodes had on me when I was drawing for hours.   He said all he could do was to treat the symptoms.  Thank God for such a kind man.  I had been going to Dr. for months and they had given me nothing to help get me through this horrible.By now my family leave had ran out and I lost my job.   I cannot drive a car, and have not since that first episode.I cannot walk around the block.   knowing I could pass out.  My grandmother stayed during the daytime and my husband took care of me at night even tho he was given out from a 12 hour job.  We went to another Neuroglist and to another Rhematologist,  as well as other Drs.  that were suggested.  None of them knew how to help me.   The Neurologist did start me on a low dose of siesure meds.   I am still experiencing episodes and causing my husband many heartaches.     Can you tell me what could be wrong  or what type of Dr. do I go to next.   Which way do we turn now.  Please help.    My insurance will run out in may.     What do I do then?  May God guide your thoughts as you ponder this.  Thank you.<|eot_id|>",

There are reports of worsening of autoimmune disease after taking Echinacea So your wife should stop taking this product. You may try Tulsa leaf if available.

Will not be harmful. She may continue to take it Bio C - it contains 250 mg vitamin C the daily requirement is 60 mg only you are already getting 90 mg from nutritive daily.  So unnecessary Siberian ginseng with ginkgo Balboa - they claim it improves mental sharpness Not necessary for your wives current disease. I would suggest you give priority to optimal treatment than spending thousands on supplements. Consult a pulmonologist and endocrinologist.

Identifying the allergen is crucial, and if possible, avoiding it completely is the best approach. 😊 A detailed allergy test can help pinpoint what you're reacting to, which is a great first step.\n\nOnce you know your allergens, consider starting a combination of antihistamines like levocetirizine or fexofenadine, along with an anti-allergic medication such as montelukast, taken once a day at night. If you experience respiratory symptoms, inhaled bronchodilators like formoterol or albuterol, along with inhaled corticosteroids like budesonide or fluticasone, can be beneficial. Using these treatments consistently for about six months can lead to significant improvement.\n\nAlways consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new treatment to ensure it's right for you. You're taking a positive step by seeking help, and I wish you the best on your journey to better health! 💙<|eot_id|>",

It is quite common for babies of this age group to pass a small amount of diarrhea or loose stools soon after feeds. This need not be treated as diarrhea and especially antibiotics are not indicated. When the kid takes food, the stomach expands - then when it is contracting it sets off a waveform which moves down the intestines and when that wave reaches the lower down rectum, a small quantity of the stool is evacuated out. This is the basis for gastronomic reflex. Do not worry. Unless the kids having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. The other possibility when it related is passing motion immediately after food is that it could have been worm infestation. Hope I have answered your query.

If you haven't had a urinalysis or ultrasound yet, it might be helpful to get those tests done to identify any underlying issues like stones or reflux. If a urinary infection is confirmed, a course of antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin, may be necessary for effective treatment.\n\nMaintaining good hygiene, especially after sexual activity, can help prevent lower urinary infections.

In order to help you more I will need more information about your health like did you have kidney infection or a lower urinary tract infection? Was any ultrasound done? Was there any complaint of kidney stone or ureteric reflux in your test? Kidney infection is an upper urinary tract infection which usually occurs from a blood spread on body infection or spread from lower urinary tract due to obstruction in tract or urinary reflux. I will advise get your urinalysis done and get an ultrasound done if not done previous to find if any cause of stone/reflux. If diagnosed a urinary infection proper course of antibiotics like ciprofloxacin for 5 to 7 days is needed to treat completely. You can have lower urinary infection from sex if not proper hygiene is maintained. Always pass urine after sex to avoid this. Hope this helped, contact back for future query. Takecare!<|eot_id|>"

It's true that sometimes an ECG may not capture all instances of MI, which is why additional tests are important for confirmation. If there are signs of an infarction and you’re close to a hospital that can perform a PCI within 90 minutes, it's best to follow the standard protocol for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and get there as quickly as possible. If that's not feasible, receiving treatment to dissolve the clot and then transferring to a facility with PCI capabilities is a good option. \n\nIt's also important to consider other conditions like myocarditis, which can present similarly. Please remember to consult with healthcare professionals for the best course of action. Your health is a priority, and seeking timely care can make a significant difference. 💙🌟 Stay strong and take care!<|eot_id|>",

ECG cannot pick MI all times . sometimes it can miss n this y we need other test to confirm it is MI . If it is infraction n there is no facility for PCI m there is hospital nearby u can reach about before 90 min it is better to take standard protocol of ACS n ten rush to that hosp to have c.Anglo n PCI if necessary . But if is not possible then thrombosed there n shift to hosp have PCI facility ...if I were your attending at that moment I would make sure it is ACS BCS myocarditis also have same features ...

As per the description, you suffer CERVICAL DISC DISEASE with RADICULOPATHY. As you have loss of muscle strength in your right arm, surgical decompression is necessary. Cervical discectomy yields excellent outcomes as you have only a single level disease. But there are certain complications inherent to the surgical procedure (like injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve causing hoarseness of voice, injury to the esophagus or to the trachea etc.). Also, this procedure has to be carried out under GENERAL ANESTHESIA which by itself can produce many complications.

Cancer is a challenging diagnosis and the course of disease is directed by treatment. With stage 3A stomach cancer about a third of people (38%) live at least 5 years. With stage 3B about 1 in 6 people (15%) live for more than 5 years. Survival for 5 years after first detection of cancer is a milestone and with the best treatments patients can survive 5 years or more with stage 3 stomach cancer.However, the staging has changed after 17 of 20 lymph nodes show metastasis, and presently it is in stage 4. Unfortunately, about 8 out of 10 (80%) people diagnosed with stomach cancer are stage four, meaning the cancer has already spread when they are diagnosed and this is the case with your father-in-law. Therefore, the survival statistics are lower than for stage 3 stomach cancers. Fewer than 1 in 20 people (5%) live for at least 5 years if they have stage 4 stomach cancer when they are diagnosed.<|eot_id|>"

He was taken into the house and put into the tub by me, I scrubbed his face and flushed his eye repeatedly until he was feeling relief. Two days later Thursday at 5am I woke up for work and I thought I was having a stroke . The right side of my face was drooping and felt numb.My husband drove me to the ER. They did a neurological Exam and a CT and chest X ray and Lab work,The diagnosis was Bells Palsy. Is it possible that the contact with the skunk spray could have triggered this condition. Is it possible that the skunk spray substance could have triggered this nervous system problem. Thanks for taking the time to read my letter. Linda/ age 55<|eot_id|>",

It's understandable to wonder about the connection with the skunk spray incident, but studies suggest that skunk spray is not harmful in a way that would cause facial paralysis. \n\nIt's always best to consult with a neurologist who can provide more personalized guidance and help determine the cause of your symptoms. You're taking a positive step by seeking answers, and I encourage you to keep advocating for your health. 💙<|eot_id|>",

Bells palsy is considered an idiopathic facial paralysis. There are many etiologic agents with a shared common pathway leading to facial neuropathy. Herpes simplex virus is the most likely etiologic agent of the Bells palsy, but there is different debate on this since many years. As you described the incident happened 2 days prior you got paralysis can not be in relation with the palsy because it is found that Skunk spray is a non-lethal deterrent and does not contain any poisons or other harmful chemicals that would cause permanent damage, even when exposed to the membranes of the eyes, nose or even mouth. So I don't think it has any relation with Bells palsy. But you can discuss with neurologist to find out the cause. Take care, Regaurds<|eot_id|>"

And usually your blood pressure use to be low but now its 138/87. Blood pressure is still key and not so high, but I would like to know do you have diabetes? If yes then since when? As well are you taking any medication for blood pressure? There are many things unclear so I am giving you general guideline. For varicose vein issue I suggest to use stocking to control it as well consult a vascular surgeon for his opinion. Here based on severity of problem doctor will guide you either for surgical management or conservative treatment with medication and regular use of stocking and doing physiotherapy treatment as well exercises. Now for your ankle swelling if this goes off along with varicose vein then good but if not as well till the time it is taking time to go away I suggest to use hot and cold pack for some pain relief and keep your leg elevated for reducing swelling. You can also use crew bandage or stocking at ankle level also to reduce the swelling. Keep doing frequent ankle-toe movement for reducing swelling further with muscle action. Here if you follow the steps by step process as per my suggestion it will definitely help you. Take care.<|eot_id|>"

I started smoking 12 months back, and I smoked about 2 cigarettes a day. Now it considerably increased to 5 cigarettes and I have cough that wouldnt go. Also, I have two patches on the either side of my inner cheeks, one is blackish (no pain, no swelling), and a scratch kind of white line on the other (no pain, no swelling). I have been coughing regularly for 25 -30 days now and have this strong urge as if there is something thats caught in my throat. Mucus is been produced normally out of cough. Two days before, I consulted a dentist and he said theres nothing to worry. I am taking antibiotics now. Some relief is there but i dont understand what is this. My tongue has few cuts fro the past two days and has this strange burning sensation. When i scratch these cuts, blood comes out (but very very little, as these are scratches that may have caused due to hard brushing that I do). Mucus is producing, I am clearing my throat every time im coughing. Im spitting it out. My throat is not comfortable these days. But since the time i have started taking medicines, amox and citrizine, it has gone a bit better. Im 24 smoking from 1 year, almost 4 cigs an average, should I worry??/<|eot_id|>",

These symptoms are also precursor of bronchial asthma (childhood), so avoidance help greatly. When such type of patient visit my clinic I prescribe them to take montelukast+albuterol (10 mg / kg body weight of each tablet). Usually patient respond at once, no need of any antibiotics. When complete relief, stop the Chat Doctor.  Levitate is an anti histamine and combination of levoceterizine + montelukast (these only act as an anti allergen) but your son require BRONCHODILATOR.

There are local anesthetic sprays or gargles that are used for sore throats or lesions of the mouth that may help you. They do not normally require a prescription. You can speak to your local pharmacist to see what is available in your area. In addition, if the pain is so severe, you may need to a stronger analgesic, but these may require a prescription. Medications such as Celebrex, tramadol, codeine may be helpful to you. I hope this helps<|eot_id|>"

Therefore any seemingly superficial skin injury in the knuckles especially open wounds is of concern to us orthopedic surgeons' BEC there is a high likelihood that bacteria and other foreign body can easily penetrate the joint and be left there. This injury can be easily missed out and be treated as a superficial skin wound. Skin can heal but if there is continued swelling here are possible causes you have an infection of the tendonoryou have an infection of the join tor you have an infection of the boner lastly it can be an abscess BEC of retained bacteria just underneath the ski nits very less likely to injure a bone(fracture) via table saw injury...bones are strong against slicing forces so less likely.

In the last year four family member passed away including my mother grandparents and uncle. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder but I think I have PTSD also as my mother died with her eyes open and me holding her hand. The reason I think I have PTSD is what triggered this episode was me picking up an earn that was made for my mothers ashes in preparation for her memorial service. Needless to say Im suffering from all the related symptoms of both depression and ptsd . A month earlier I went to the doctor and was prescribed Zoloft but the effects were debilitating wrenching stomach pain and diarrhea I lost 12 pounds in  a month. I slowly reduced the dosage in preparation of a change in medication to Prozac and before I could change medication I began to have suicidal thoughts which led me to seek help. Now out of the hospital and with a little time to reflect on the situation Im taking the new medication which is making me confused ,sleepy and full of anxiety. I was prescribed Xanax for anxiety and only take it sparingly when I begin to have chest pain ,stomach pain and sometimes shortness of breath. I have called the hospital and have been accepted into there outpatient program which consists of 3 hrs of therapy twice a week for five weeks which starts this next Monday. Im hoping that with therapy some of these issues can be solved. Any advice would be greatly appreciated .  Thank you , Matt<|eot_id|>",

It's important to know that simvastatin is used to manage high cholesterol and isn't directly linked to chest pain. However, since you have high cholesterol, it’s crucial to rule out coronary artery disease (CAD) as a potential cause of your symptoms. \n\nI recommend consulting a cardiologist who can perform necessary tests like blood pressure monitoring, an ECG, a 2D echocardiogram, and possibly a stress test. These steps can help ensure your heart health is properly assessed. 💙 \n\nTake care of yourself, and don't hesitate to seek the support you need. You're not alone in this! 🌟<|eot_id|>",

I can understand your concern. First simvastatin has nothing to do with left sided chest pain. You are taking simvastatin, so you are suffering for high cholesterol. So you are at risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). So we should first rule out CAD as a cause for your persistent left sided chest pain. So consult cardiologist and get done blood pressure monitoring, ECG, 2d echo and stress test (trade mill test). You may need cardiac supportive Chat Doctor.  Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.<|eot_id|>"

If you got your period on the expected date, it's likely that you are not pregnant. However, if you experienced any bleeding before that date, it could be worth considering the possibility of implantation bleeding. 😊\n\nYour symptoms may suggest a urinary tract infection (UTI), which can be uncomfortable.

They may also recommend checking your serum iron and ferritin levels for iron deficiency, as well as B12 levels for vitamin deficiency.\n   \n2.

Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint it seems that swelling over the face can be due to anesthesia injection, in case if the anesthesia injection is injected deep and that too for the upper back teeth and if the needle is penetrated deep it can enter the mesh of veins known as Venous plexus and there can be hematoma formation, and it can lead to swelling. Other cause can be due to dental abscess if the swelling was present before injection also. In case if it is due to hematoma formation it can take a few days to resolve and for this you do not need any medications and can do alternate warm and cool compresses. In case if it is due to abscess, the filling needs to be removed, tooth needs to be cleaned again and pus needs to be Chat Doctor. .

A positive IGM indicates an active infection, which can be concerning, especially during pregnancy due to the risk of congenital malformations. 😊 It's great that you're not planning to get pregnant soon, as using a reliable method of contraception is very important right now. \n\nWhen you're ready to consider pregnancy in the future, it's wise to repeat these tests. If the results are still concerning at that time, treatment may be necessary. Your health and well-being are important, so please consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

Because they are positive(IGM), it means there is an active infection going on. Our body are usually strong enough to get these infections under control unless we have a weakened immune system. They however pose the greatest risk during pregnancy because if the risk of congenital malformation. Because you are not planning to get pregnant any time soon, I will strongly advise that you get a very good method of contraception and repeat these tests in future when you wish to become pregnant. If they are still worrisome, then I will advise you to go for treatment. For now, contraception and repeat when you consider becoming pregnant in the future.

The pill works by delaying ovulation, which can sometimes lead to hormonal changes and a delay in your period by about 8-10 days. \n\nIt's completely normal to feel anxious during this time, but try not to worry too much. You may expect your period to arrive within the next week. If you have any further questions or concerns, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

I pill when taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex, avoids pregnancy. Earlier the pill is taken better are the results (protection)You had taken it within 24 hours of sex. So you are sure to avoid pregnancy.  I pill is a high dose hormone product. It acts by postponing ovulation. So there is hormonal imbalance in cycle & periods are delayed by 8-10 days than normal.  Please do not worry. You will get period in next week's time.  Thanks.<|eot_id|>"

There are various reasons for elevated SGPT, including hepatitis, alcohol intake, and certain medications. It's good to know that the liver is enlarged, as this can guide further evaluation. 😊\n\nTo get a clearer picture, additional tests like random blood sugar, liver function tests, and a lipid profile are important. After a thorough evaluation, your healthcare provider may recommend medications, such as ursodeoxycholic acid, which can support liver cell regeneration. It’s common for SGPT levels to take 4-6 months to normalize, so patience is key. \n\nAvoiding alcohol, increasing physical activity, and steering clear of fried and fatty foods can greatly benefit your liver health. Remember, consulting with your healthcare professional is essential for personalized advice. Wishing you a smooth recovery and better health ahead! 💙<|eot_id|>",

You need few other investigations like random blood sugar, liver function test, lipid profile. You may need to take some medicines after proper evaluation. I suggest my patients to take tablet ursodeoxycholic acid 300 mg twice daily for three months. It helps in regeneration of liver cells.

It’s true that ORS and water are essential for hydration during this time. 😊 The taste of some medicines can be unpleasant, which might lead to vomiting, especially in young children who can’t express their discomfort. \n\nAs the infection resolves, you may notice changes in the color of the stools. In the meantime, giving the medicine on an empty stomach and following it with something tasty can help reduce the aftertaste and the chance of vomiting. \n\nIt’s important to be patient during this process. If you have any concerns or if symptoms persist, please consult a healthcare professional for further guidance. You're doing your best for your little one! 💙<|eot_id|>",

For lose motions ORS and water is definitely needed.This medicine as you said has good effect on motions. Medicines do have other effects too. These medicines are bad to taste, also it leads to metallic taste which obviously the toddler is unable to explain but expressing it in the for of vomiting. Infection will take some time to resolve along the time color of motions will change.In the meantime you can give the child medicine on empty stomach and offer something immediately after it, so he does not continue with after-taste of the medicine, stop vomiting. Have patience.<|eot_id|>"

This can be really challenging and emotional. 😊 \n\nBuserelin is a medication that affects hormone levels, and while it can help with ovulation, long-term use may impact the release of other important hormones. There are many factors involved in conception, including male semen analysis and female ovulation processes. It’s important to ensure that both partners are evaluated thoroughly. \n\nGetting a second opinion from another gynecologist can provide more insights and options for your situation. It’s okay to seek support and explore different avenues. Remember, you’re not alone in this journey. 💙 \n\nAlways consult with your healthcare professionals for personalized advice and guidance.

Forum. Since you both are receiving treatment for infertility and still not conceiving, this is a cause of concern. Buserellin is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist, scored is also stimulate ovulation (indirectly), F S H is also getting. As long term use of buserellin suppresses release of LH / F S H, this is not good. Still it is not clear why, you are not conceiving? For conception many factors play roles as in MALE semen analysis (if sperm count is standard and morphology and motility is good then need not worry). So upload the report over this site. In Female OVULATION, FSH / L H ratio, endometrium thickness, follicles maturation, burst of maturated follicles, release of ovum, fertilization of ovum, implantation in uterus, so get in ultrasound report of ovaries with follicles study. Consult one more Gynecologist and get his opinion (2nd). Hope I have answered your question. Good luck.<|eot_id|>"

It's true that some individuals may not ovulate even while on medication, and increasing the dose can be an option, but it's essential to do this under your doctor's guidance.

It will take weeks to months to subside. Use ring cushion and take site bath [sitting in lukewarm water for 10 min]Take analgesic like Nicosia 90 once daily along with tab methylcobalamine 1500 mcg once daily. If not relieved with all these methods then local injection may be required. You can take this consulting your doctor.

Also like a blueish tint to my skin like i wore a brand new pair of dark jeans, even know i didnt even wear dark or new jeans that day. I tried washing it off so i know its not dye. Im also on topamax but ive been on it for awhile now, 50mg of that.<|eot_id|>",

I have some doubts and clarifications regarding my daughter who is 17 year old and now studying in Kerala , India  in 11 grade.. She is in Convent school hostel now and she is not interested in studies at all.  I have two daughters and I brought them up alone as i am separated from my husband from 2001 to 2010.(He was in Muscat at that time and went with some lady  means he has some other relations. Because of her behaviour ,I thought of briging him back as per his brothers request if he can live as a family . But again he is leading the old life with many other relations.now he is not with us) She is very much addicted to mobile phones and internet even though i have restricted these 2 upto certain level. she used chat with unknown males in my absence and she is saying they are her friends. I tried my maximum to make her understand the meaning of friends and also the  problems of  such behaviour. Now whenever I spoke to her in the hostel over phone she is complainig that she cannot continue in the hostel and I know it is because of that strict  not having access to internet and mobile. now the way she behaves is creating a lot of problems to me .she used to scribble something daily in her dairy and it is like she is living in fantasy world with her friend. She used to tell other children and warden that she used to go out with him etc which was not happened. the person she is talking about is not even seen her earlier.  Earlier two years back i tried to consult a phycologists with her, she came one day and she didnt come for second time.  I would be gateful if you can suggest some possible way how to take her to a normal life.Many Thanks,AAAAA<|eot_id|>",

Growing up in a single-parent household can indeed have a significant impact on a child's development, especially when there are issues like the absence of a father figure and inconsistent supervision.

Engaging her in structured activities can also be beneficial in helping her adjust and feel more secure. 🌟\n\nRemember, you're not alone in this, and seeking professional guidance can make a big difference.

She also might have witnessed her fathers' attitude towards the family or towards you who is her mother and as you say he was promiscuous. She has not had a father figure in her life and may have had improper parental supervision for many of these stated reasons. All this can have a negative impact on the development of a children personality. A person can have deviant personality traits which make them more vulnerable to problems like addiction or excessive usage of things like the internet and mobile phones to an extent of neglect of routine activities, seeking fulfillment of emotional needs from strangers, especially of the opposite gender or confabulating or manipulating by making up stories in order to get what they want. Firstly it would be advisable to get a detailed psychiatric evaluation at this point to rule out the possibility of any underlying mental illness. To make sure she does not truly believe the stories she has been telling people. You also need to make sure she is not having any genuine adjustment problems in the hostel. If this happens to be her way of manipulating you into getting her out of hostel then it would be advisable to keep her in the hostel till she gets used to it eventually. Get in touch with her hostel authorities and try to be aware of her behavior and also see if they can help you out by keeping her constantly engaged in some activities by making a schedule for her daily activities till late in the evening, by including sports, studies, projects, monitoring etc. This would help her a great deal.

Given your history of tuberculosis, the linear density is more likely to indicate fibrosis, which is a healed stage of infection and usually doesn't need intervention. \n\nIt's important to stay in touch with your healthcare provider for personalized advice. Take care, and remember that you're not alone in this journey. 💙<|eot_id|>",

She is an active happy little girl who seems perfectly healthy but she complains about her tummy hurting all the time. Its always right after she eats and sometimes in the morning before she eats. She is completely fine all other moments so it doesnt slow her down or anything. But she mentions it enough for me to be concerned. Im starting to worry that she may have something wrong with her stomach or even a possibly food allergy. My sister has celiac disease so thats a concern for me that she may have it as well.<|eot_id|>",

This can happen when there's an abscess at the root of the tooth, leading to pus formation and a sinus opening in the gums. \n\nIt's really important to visit your dentist for an evaluation and possibly an X-ray to check for any infection. Taking care of this promptly can help prevent further issues. Wishing you a smooth recovery! 😊💙<|eot_id|>",

Canker sore does not stay for so long, it takes maximum 7-14 days to heal. The type of lesion you are mentioning, it can be a sinus opening, as it is present above the tooth in the gums. It is condition, which occur when a tooth is infected and there is an abscess formation in the apex of the tooth, and when the pus starts coming out it forms a sinus opening. You should visit your dentist and get an x-ray done of that tooth as it will show the infection. Hope it will help you.<|eot_id|>"

If you've taken multiple home pregnancy tests and they are all negative, it’s understandable to feel confused. 😊 It's important to remember that there could be various reasons for missed periods, and sometimes the testing method can affect results. \n\nUsing your first morning urine for the test can improve accuracy, so it might be worth trying that one more time. If the test is still negative, consulting a gynecologist would be a good next step to explore other potential causes. \n\nRegarding the nausea, diarrhea, and cramps, these symptoms could indeed be related to gastroenteritis or food poisoning.

If you people had unprotected sexual intercourse during unsafe period then chances of pregnancy are more. If you are pregnant the HPT should come positive in at least one test among the 8 tests you have done, I don't think all 8 Hits will give false negatives. It would have better if you had visited a gynecologist by now. There could be some other reason for missed periods or the way of doing HPT could be wrong. Please do it one more time using early morning urine sample, if that also negative you should definitely consult a doctorNausea, diarrhea, cramps all could be due gastroenteritis caused by food poisoning. Don't be stressed and consult a gynecologist as early as possible. Regards Chat Doctor.<|eot_id|>"

Since you mentioned you had a direct impact onto the knee and your shin and foot are sore, you need to first rule out if any old fracture is present or any bony misalignment. This can be ruled out by a CT/MRI/X-ray.you said you exercised a lot, but what exercises you performed is important. You even had a fall on a concrete, So the impact will be big enough. As bone is a hard tissue and muscle is a soft tissue, the impact will be varied by landing on the muscle and different from landing on the bone. Once your X-ray/CT/MRI shows all fine you can look ahead to next step or else you need to strictly follow the or tho guidelines. For time being I can only say to do hot water fermentation until you visit the doctor.Self-medication and self-healing is not advisable as specialist can help better. There is nothing wrong taking their opinion. With the grace of god I wish you a great health. RegardsJay In Chat Doctor.<|eot_id|>"

Your body produces sperm and semen, which need to be expelled, and this can happen through various means, including nocturnal ejaculation.\n\nThe dark circles and changes in your facial appearance may indeed be linked to stress and anxiety, often stemming from misunderstandings about sexual health.

Night fall (nocturnal ejaculation) is not due to excess masturbation. In fact, masturbation controls night fall. You should understand the process. Your body produces sperm cells and semen whenever it is sexually aroused. The produced semen is stored within your body, and it is a waste product now. Body needs to throw the waste out. If you masturbate or engage in sex, the waste goes out. Otherwise, body finds its own way to expel the waste and the ways are through nocturnal ejaculation or through urine. Dark circles near eyes, loosening of cheeks etc. are due to stress. Stress is due to anxiety which is caused by your wrong or insufficient knowledge about masturbation, sex, sexual organs and other aspects. I suggest you to consult a psychologist for sexual counseling. Take care. If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL. http<|eot_id|>"

They took x-rays and said it wasn t an abcess but that instead I have cysts in my gums. They then told me that in order to stop the pain I had to have a tooth removed that was above the cysts. I did this. At no point in time were these cysts ever removed. At no point in time were these cysts ever biopsied. The tooth was pulled....Im still in pain almost a year later. and now the tooth behind it is broken. My wisdom tooth is impacted and pushing on the now broken one. I have been in severe pain for the past 2 days. Tried everything I could possibly think of and could find online to kill my pain or even help a little bit. Today, I was sucking on my tounge (my salt water was a little too salty) and in the process was sucking on the broken tooth as well. I had the most horrible pain of my life and then blood pouring out of my mouth. Toothache was gone after that for about 5 1/2 hours. Now pain comes back and is worse. My jaw feels like it is going to explode and again more blood. This lasted for about 5 min (although it felt like years) and now pain is gone. What could be causing all this pain?

The small swellings you've mentioned, being less than 1 cm, are often not significant, especially since you don't have other symptoms that might suggest lymphoma.\n\nMonitoring the lymph nodes for any changes in size is a good plan. If they do increase, a biopsy can provide more clarity. Additionally, checking your urine for any abnormal cells or infections is important, and a culture can help rule out any issues. \n\nIt's always best to consult with your healthcare provider for personalized advice and support.

Switching from atenolol to a medication like labetalol, which has intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, may help reduce the risk of bradycardia.

Mostly you have essential hypertension.  When you say LVH on echo, it means the BP was on higher side to cause LVH, as you say telmisartan and clear are good Chat Doctor.  Now on the important issue of beta blocker, you tend to get bradycardia with ten 50\\u00a0mg in a day, as you are on so many years on beta blocker, and we want to medically manage HD, we should optimize the dose.  Do try replacement of atenolol with Weibull, which has intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, so bradycardia is less than compared to ten. Take blood pressure at different times of the day, and dose the antihypertensive accordingly to minimize peaks and troughs. Lastly get you TSH and free t3/ free t4 next time to see whether we are over treating or undertaking hypothyroidism<|eot_id|>"

Also if a PET scan shows inflammation in the lymph nodes, but the lymph nodes appear normal how likely might it be that the inflammation is residual effects from the radiation,or rather that the cancer returned?<|eot_id|>",

The timing is indeed crucial; waiting about 12 weeks allows for better differentiation between scar tissue and potential cancer. 😊 After this period, if there's FDG uptake, it’s less likely to be due to radiation-induced inflammation. \n\nAt 7 weeks, it can be challenging to determine the cause of any uptake, as it might still be related to the treatment. Typically, diffuse and low to moderate uptake is associated with radiation effects, while focal and intense uptake could suggest something more concerning, like cancer or infection. \n\nIt's important to discuss these findings with your healthcare team, as they can provide personalized insights and support.

But the timing of PET scan is very, very important. After radiation therapy, it is ideal to wait for 12 weeks before radiation induced inflammation becomes normal. If FDG uptake occurs after 12 weeks from completion of radiation, it is not radiation induced inflammation. At 7 weeks, it becomes difficult to conclusively say if its cancer or radiation induced inflammation. But the dictum if radiation induced FDG uptake is usually diffuse and low to moderate grade. A focal area of uptake usually indicates another problem like cancer or infection. Recurrent cancer is usually focal and intense, though it's not a dictum in all the cases.<|eot_id|>"

After 1 minute, the brain cells start to die. After 3 minutes, the damage is usually serious. After 5 minutes, the damage is usually major. After 10 minutes, the damage is usually irreversible. After 15 minutes, recovery is usually not possible. Best of luck. Feel free to contact us for more information on the related issue.<|eot_id|>"

Early or mild symptoms can often respond well to non-surgical treatments. 😊 Physical therapy can be really beneficial in improving strength and flexibility in your trunk and legs. Additionally, making nutritional changes and engaging in aerobic exercise can help with weight loss, which can reduce stress on your lumbar spine.\n\nInjections into the epidural space or spinal joints may also help decrease inflammation and alleviate back or leg pain. Some people find relief through alternative treatments like acupuncture.

Surgical correction is very risky and 100% successful correction of the deformity is next to impossible. But if patient is having underlying lung developmental defect, breathlessness, collapsed lung, low oxygen saturation etc. than only surgical correction is required. Just for the cosmetic purpose, better not to go for surgery. And if surgery is indicated than repositioning of breastbone with removal of cartilage is best option. Hope I have solved your query.

As per your complaint lack of appetite and brown yellow stools after intake of antibiotics can be due to probably Clostridium Difficile infection that can occur due to disturbance in the normal bacterial flora of intestines leading to Infection caused by Clostridium bacteria. You should consult a Gastroenterologist and get evaluated and a thorough clinical evaluation and investigation like blood test, occult stool test and Endoscopy can help in diagnosis and treatment can be done accordingly. In case of C. Diff you can be advised Metronidazole, fidoxamycin etc. along with plenty of Probiotics like Yogurt and taking ample of fluids and light diet. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards. Chat Doctor.<|eot_id|>"

This is not true gallstones showing up in the stool. Some sort of chemical reaction between olive oil and lemon juice, forms oily balls colored green by bile and comes out in the stool and floats. Real gallstones sink in the water. This liver cleansing and gallbladder cleansing is a quackery. What you probably had been an acute dilatation of the stomach due to excess gas from the butter and cookie dough. Ginger facilitates some digestive process and hence the beeps. When the stomach is quite distended, that causes pressure on the nerve endings and that is the reason for shoulder pain (Pressure on the diaphragm) and the back pain. I am sure, when once the stomach empties, and you expel all the gas, you should feel better. I suggest that you get an upper GI x-rays and also a sonogram of the gallbladder to see if you have real gallstones. Try to stay away from fatty and greasy foods. I wish you well.<|eot_id|>"

Having a small cavity would not indicate a need for an antibiotic. If you are experiencing discomfort and any signs of inflammation around the tooth, discuss with your dentist the need to take pre-operative medication. Your dentist may recommend an anti-inflammatory medication to start shortly before the planned extraction. Antibiotics are not absolutely necessary prior to an extraction. It is important not to overuse antibiotics. Resistance to antibiotics are a risk. Blindness is generally not a risk with an extraction. Complications from an extraction, infection with the spread of inflammation, and an unusual nerve anatomy may result in some possible conditions that may involve eye function. Paresthesia is a risk associated with injections and possible with extractions. This would be numbness remaining instead of wearing off as normally expected. Often with time this will diminish unless there is a dual nerve damage. Preoperative x-rays are taken to evaluate root proximity to nerves. You should review all possible complications and your medical history impact with your dentist prior to the extraction. Thank you for your inquiry. I hope you feel better about having your extraction and that my comments have been helpful to you.<|eot_id|>"

If no such suggestive history, we need a basic workup to rule out conditions like anemia, chronic infection/inflammation or hematological disorders. If I were his treating doctor, after examining him for pallor and enlarged lymph nodes/spleen/liver, I will order few more tests including a blood count, ESR and peripheral smear. Kindly discuss with a pediatrician. Take care. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.<|eot_id|>"

I recently moved to a very remote area and dont have any Specialty Drs. here. I last saw my hematologist in Dec 2012. He said he thought it was showers of micro clotting and to double up on my asprin and folic acid every other day. That worked for a few months but know the chest pain is back and it moves around and is very unsettling, it also seems to get worse with my menstral cycle. I dont know what to do anymore.

It sounds challenging to deal with the thickening of your blood and the potential for clots. 😊 The chest pain you're feeling could indeed be related to microclots in your pulmonary vessels.\n\nIt's important to note that while aspirin is a common treatment, it may not be sufficient on its own to prevent clot formation. Starting a medication like Tab Action, along with aspirin and folic acid, could be beneficial. Regular monitoring of your Prothrombin time (PT INR) is also crucial to ensure your levels are within the target range.\n\nPlease remember to consult with your healthcare professional about these recommendations and any changes to your treatment plan. You deserve the best care possible, and I'm here to support you on this journey. 💙<|eot_id|>",

As your details it seems that you are suffering from Congenital hypercoagulable disease. In this case, the blood getting thick day by day and causes clots at any site. Most common is lower large vein due to more stagnant condition. This clot frequently embolizes to chest and causes chest pain that is called Pulmonary embolism. With your description, you are suffering from Chronic pulmonary embolism that also causes right heart chamber enlargement and bilateral leg swelling. But you did not mention regarding breathlessness and leg swelling except chest pain on and off. Definitely this chest pain is due to microclot in pulmonary vessel. But the treatment you are taking is very ineffective. Aspirin is not enough alone to prevent the clot formation and keep the blood thin. So my advice is to start Tab Action with lower dose 2 mg once a day along with aspirin with folic acid. And do your Prothrombin time (PT INR) at regular interval of 15-30 days to keep your INR 2 to 2.5Thank You<|eot_id|>"

Don't hesitate to ask the lab for specific instructions on how to handle the sample properly. Remember, one semen report alone doesn't provide a complete picture.

This could be related to a viral infection of the parotid gland known as mumps. Mumps can cause swelling on one or both sides of the face due to inflammation of the salivary glands. 😊 \n\nTypically, symptoms can last about 7 to 10 days. It's important to consult a physician for a proper evaluation. They may recommend tests like blood work or imaging to confirm the diagnosis. While there isn't a specific treatment for mumps, you can find relief with pain relievers like acetaminophen, cold compresses, and staying hydrated with fluids like water and soups. Eating a soft, nutritious diet and getting plenty of rest can also help. \n\nIf your symptoms persist beyond 10 days without improvement, please reach out to a healthcare professional. Remember, once you've had mumps, you usually gain lifelong immunity. Take care of yourself, and I hope you feel better soon! 💙<|eot_id|>",

Can understand your concern. As per your complaint it seems that swelling on both sides of cheeks and face can be due to viral infection of the parotid gland known as Mumps. Mumps also known as \\\"Epidemic Parotitis\\\" is a VIRAL infection, and it can affect either one side or both sides Parotid glands which are major salivary glands leading to the above explained symptoms. The symptoms subside within 7 to 10 days after the symptoms appear. Consult a Physician and get evaluated and investigation like blood test,x-ray and salivary amylase test can help in confirmation of the cause and treatment can be done accordingly. There is no exact treatment for mumps and only symptomatic relief can be provided. For pain, you can take Acetaminophen or Tylenol for relief. Doing cold compresses can be relieving. Take plenty of fluids which can include water, fruit juices, soups etc. Take a soft and nutritious diet. Take sufficient rest. In case if the symptoms persist for more than 10 days without any relief you should consult a physician. Although after occurrence of mumps once the person becomes immune for lifetime and relapse can be with very mild symptoms. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards.<|eot_id|>"

The orginal reason i got the wisdoms out was becasue my regular dentist wanted to prevent those molars from getting bad (one was causing me pain already, and has a very large cavity underneath the filling). I have noticed that the back molars are now not in line with my other teeth at all anymore. They are all off to the side a bit, they do not touch at all when I bite down. Im worried I now will need to have all 4 of them pulled. Will they go back to the position they were in before they had to remove the wisdm teeth(all were impacted). And I hope the taste of pus will go way too.....its just the healing right?<|eot_id|>",

Based on the facts of your query, In my opinion you need to check out the diagnosis before planning the treatment of your sons' biceps knot, with your Surgeon for a Second Opinion. Confirm the ambiguity of the cause of the lump. Xray of the shoulder / and or / USG / CT Shoulder /biceps area and FNAC Biopsy with Homeopath study would fix the cause from your Surgeon. There are many causes like -Sarcoma Granuloma/Fibrous/periosteal tumors/Erythema Nodes/ which need to be ruled out. As the fever /pain is not there, your case becomes more challenging and would need a team of doctors-Surgeon/Orthopedic/Physician to fix the diagnosis. Such a lump after proper diagnosis could be treated by your doctor according to its cause. Hope you got the answer for your query. Hope this would help you.

(This was on June 26th) I went to the doctor and she said it was low BP (80/60) and gave me some drops to feel better, I felt slightly better but kept getting very dizzy to the point I could not even walk more than 5 min. I went to the cardiologist and the ear doctor and they both said I was ok, and gave me some Medicibe for the dizziness, which helped a little but u was still feeling I could not breath and I got insomnia as well. Then went to the ER and my blood results were ok and they sent me home. I had to take a plane back to the U.S. And even though I was very dizzy I did ok in the flight.( July 5) Doctors in Mexico though it was related to the high altitude in Mexico (8,000ft) and once I got to lower altitude it would get better. Before my trip to Mexico I participated in a triathlon (June 14) and it was really rainy and muddy, I reached Mexico on June 20th and the next day I participate in a half marathon but I could only run 8 miles and felt aweful (June 21), the next day I was ok. I have been a runner for 10 tears and t was not my first long distance run and a triathlete for 4 years. In June 5th I started getting some fever (99.2 F) and it goes away when I take paracetamol or ibuprofen but then it comes back ( usually in the evenings, around 5-6 pm), I went to the doctor and I took an urine test and a thyroid one, still waiting or results. I have had a heachae ( in the frontal part) for 2 weeks now, it occasionally goes away but comes back with the fever and have been feeling really tired, also the lights bother me a lot and can t stand the computer for more than 4 hours. I am still not sleeping 100%, keep waking up every 2-3 hours) What can it be? We had a tick problem at work and I m worried it could be related. Thanks! Monica<|eot_id|>",

It can be really challenging to navigate these situations, especially when they involve critical decisions about a loved one's care. 😊\n\nYou're right that a DNR directive requires approval from the patient or their closest family members, particularly if the patient is unable to communicate. The evaluation by neurologists and psychiatrists is crucial to determine the best course of action. When a patient is taken off the ventilator, the medical team closely monitors their ability to breathe independently, and if they struggle, they can be placed back on the ventilator quickly to ensure their safety.\n\nRegarding CPR, the effectiveness can indeed vary based on the patient's overall health and condition at the time of the event.

This could be related to several conditions, including subcutaneous candidiasis, atopic dermatitis, allergic reactions, or even some underlying medical issues like diabetes or jaundice. 😊 \n\nIt's important for her to consult a dermatologist who can recommend appropriate antifungal medications and supportive treatments. Additionally, discussing the possibility of immunoglobulin therapy with the dermatologist might be beneficial. If the itching persists without a clear diagnosis, seeing a physician to rule out any underlying medical disorders is a wise step. \n\nAllergy testing can also be considered, but keep in mind that these tests may not always provide reliable results. Remember, you're not alone in this, and seeking professional help is the best way forward. 💙<|eot_id|>",

If still no diagnosis or cure then it would be advisable to consult physician to rule out any medical disorders. You can go for allergic testing of food and other substances, but they are not such reliable. Thanks.<|eot_id|>"

It’s true that while most cases resolve without serious issues, there can be instances where it persists, especially in individuals with weakened immune systems. 🌟 \n\nIf you suspect you might have a chronic infection, getting a viral antibody test can be a helpful step in understanding your situation better. Treatment can be complex, and working with a specialist in chronic fatigue may provide the support you need. \n\nRemember, it’s important to consult with healthcare professionals who can guide you through this process.

I read and understand your concern. I am Chat Doctor answering your concern. Yes, infectious mononucleosis can occur as chronic infection. Usually the infection of infectious mononucleosis is very benign, it will be cured without any adverse consequences. But in some cases it can be seen as chronic infection this is more common in immunocompromised states, organ transplantation and cancer chemotherapy. The prognosis for these conditions are very poor. I suspect you are having chronic infection. For the diagnosis purpose you can take the viral antibody test done. Treatment of the chronic condition is very challenging. Only chronic fatigue specialist can help you. I will be happy to answer your further concern on bit.ly/ Chat Doctor. Thank you, ChatDoctorInfectious diseases specialist, ChatDoctor.<|eot_id|>"

It's true that increasing narcotic doses can lead to withdrawal symptoms if stopped suddenly, which can be quite uncomfortable for a period of time. 😊 \n\nNerve pain can indeed be tricky, as it often follows the pathways of the nerves involved.

But then, it depends a bit on the type and etiology of the pain. If something goes in the pathway of a nerve, then that is the nerve involved. Nerves are long and the pain is in a belt-like long pathway. Smaller areas are smaller nerves. This also tends to say what might be going on. Obviously if there was an injury to the area and then there was pain outward from it \\\"hit a nerve\\\" would be a possibility. Sick nerves are MULTIPLE areas and tends to be the TIPS of the nerve not the whole nerve. And the point is that nerve pain can also be treated by nerve pills like anti-epileptics.<|eot_id|>"

Besides, the symptoms may not manifest in front of every one for example, Paranoid type of illness is very, very notorious to be missed by everyone, esp family members, so I suggest you have complete faith in the doctors treating your uncle. The problems you mentioned are probably the side effects due to medicines. They are going to be all right in a few days time. You can always discuss whatever are your concerns with the treating doctors Best Wishes<|eot_id|>"

Staph infection on the skin can present in many ways, so you can't tell by just looking at it. You could get an abscess or a pimple-like lesion, or redness and tenderness of the skin, or a sore. Such lesions could be caused by other bacteria besides staph. If you suspect you might have a bacterial infection, be sure to keep it clean, and you can try antibiotic ointment. If it is becoming an obvious abscess, or a cellulitis where the skin gets red, inflamed, and hot to touch, that could indicate an infection that needs treatment. In that case you should see your doctor for the appropriate treatment. Hope this helps.<|eot_id|>"

I think probably you may be having allergic dermatitis along with psoriasis.... Psoriasis is a chronic relapsing and autoimmune disease. You may be having scaly plaques on various parts of the body, scaly lesions on the scalp. Exact cause is not known. Genetic tendency, autoimmunity, stress, Chat Doctor. .etc. may be responsible for precipitation and exacerbation of psoriasis. You said that from last few days you have inflamed skin with itching...that would be due to allergy. You consult dermatologist for firm diagnosis and treatment. I usually recommend cap accretion 10 mg twice a day along with methotrexate 15 mg weekly in three decided doses 12 hourly...for psoriasis. This may be taken for long time till good response. Blood tests may be done to monitor the treatment. For itching, you may take antihistamines like levocetirizine. If needed, steroid may be taken for short period in tampering dose. Antibiotic course may be considered, if there is secondary infection. You may apply mild steroid cream or calcitriol point on the lesions on the psoriasis lesions. You may apply moisturizer to improve the skin texture. Furthermore, you should avoid soap bath for few weeks. And you should free of stress and worries as that might worsen psoriasis. For inflamed skin, you may apply antibiotic cream. You might get good result. I hope you got my answer. Thanks.<|eot_id|>"

The management of allergic rhinitis consists of 3 major categories of treatment- environmental control measures and allergen avoidance- Pharmacological management- Immunotherapy, these may seem to be big words, but be rest assured that you can handle the situation at your level. First, you will need to identify by yourself if they are any new elements in your life that might be provoking any allergies i.e. identifying common allergens. Common allergens include pollen and outdoor molds, indoor allergens such as dust mites, animal allergens, cockroach etc. You will need to see if any are responsible, then you try avoiding them. Immunotherapy is only indicated in case medical therapy fails. There are a wide range of medications available witChatDoctormonly used classes being antihistamines (1st and 2nd generations) such as cetirizine, loratadine, chlorpheniramine, defense Chat Doctor.  Chronic sinusitis, on the other hand, requires in addition to some of the above treatments, antimicrobial therapy such as penicillin, cephalosporins, accolades etc. Your doctor should be able to indicate the right treatment ones a conclusion as to the exact cause of your symptoms is derived. Hope this helps<|eot_id|>"

Strongyloides stercoralis is indeed a common parasite, especially in individuals who are immunocompromised, like those with HIV.\n\nIt's important to have any suspected infections properly examined by a laboratory to confirm the diagnosis.

But it is advised you to get the worm examined by nearby laboratory. Treatment with albendazole will clear the infection.

They cause delay in people seeking modern treatment. Even if one starts on treatment, they may stop it believing in traditional treatment methods etc. Once the cancer progresses beyond any cure and patients suffer in pain etc., they return to hospitals and then It's too late for modern medicine to offer anything but pain relief and palliative care. The traditional cancer doctors are usually very nice talkers and give plenty of time and listen to patients and more or less play with vulnerable patients emotions and then once they fail they put the blame back on the patients for not doing things exactly according to their instructions etc.... Also people are cheated financially in the process. Any person advertising alternative or traditional methods and claiming cure should be prosecuted. Why people don't go for traditional medicine when they meet a traffic accident or heart attack?? Why only for cancer???? Have you thought about it? Regards<|eot_id|>"

The delay in your period is likely due to hormonal changes from the medication, which can affect your cycle. \n\nIt's important to take care of yourself during this time. Try to manage stress, eat a balanced diet, and stay active. If you have any more questions or if your period doesn't return soon, please consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice. You're doing great! 💙<|eot_id|>",

Pregnancy chance is nil because1. You have done sex in the safe period of the cycle and no ovum is released during this time, so no fertilization take place.2. Posting 2 is 95% effective in preventing pregnancy. Your period is delayed is just due to hormonal imbalance caused by the Posting 2. It contains high progesterone and cause prolongation of second phase of the cycle and delay period. Avoid stress, take healthy diet and do regular exercise.

It can be worrying when there are changes, especially without any symptoms. 😊 Here are a few possibilities to consider:\n\n1. **Interstitial pulmonary edema** could cause prominent markings, often accompanied by symptoms like pink frothy sputum and difficulty breathing.\n2. If you work in industries involving textiles or asbestos, there may be a risk of **pneumoconiosis** (like silicosis or asbestosis), which can also lead to breathing issues.\n3. Symptoms like cough, fever, and chest pain could point to **interstitial pneumonia**, possibly due to atypical viral infections.\n4. If you're experiencing increasing breathlessness without a clear cause, **idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis** might need to be ruled out.\n\nPulmonary function tests can help differentiate between restrictive and obstructive diseases, and a complete blood examination might provide additional insights. It's really important to discuss these findings with a healthcare professional who can guide you further. You're not alone in this, and there are ways to address your concerns. 💙<|eot_id|>",

If you have no symptoms at all then it has of less value. But here are few possibilities.1. First interstitial pulmonary edema can lead to such prominent marking. Patient will also complain pink frothy sputum and dyspnea.2. Second if you are working in textile industry or asbestos using industry then chances of pneumoconiosis is present like silicosis, asbestos is etc. Can lead to dyspnea with such x-ray finding.3. If you have dyspnea, cough, fever, chest pain then interstitial pneumonia like atypical viral or cytoplasm pneumonia can be the cause.4. If you have increasing breathlessness and no specific cause found for that idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis has to be ruled out. To distinguish between restrictive and obstructive disease pulmonary function test is useful. Complete blood examination also helpful. I hope my suggestion will help you.<|eot_id|>"

As you mentioned you had two RCI surgeries, I am actually not happy to hear this. RCI does not need surgery and if needed it is not performed twice. There is something which went wrong. Let's figure out this. Hope you will cooperate and provide the details. How many rotator cuff muscles were ruptured? What surgery was performed? Did you perform physical therapy before and after the surgery?what was the muscle strength before and after surgery? Well this questions decide the prognosis of the patient with Rotator cuff injury (RCI)Also, I have been seeing RCI patients with 2 out of 4 muscles rupture. Can say a 50-50% cases. All have recovered well. Neither a cortisone injection nor a surgery was done post physical therapy. Patient is above 65 and can perform all physical activities without any hesitation. As I think now you have undergone two surgeries, you need a good physical therapy which can help you regain all functional movements. Also, performing surgeries back to back is not good as it may lead to scarring of the tissues. I advise you to do 12-16 weeks of proper physical therapy to get optimum results. Any more questions, you can ask me personallyRegardsJay In Chat Doctor.<|eot_id|>"

I can understand your concerns. It seems that you are having Olecranal bursitis which is an inflammation of olecranal bursa (small sacs of fluid that help joints move smoothly) at the back of the elbow. The swelling or lump is caused by increased fluid within the bursa and is tender with movement or when touched. Mild but repeated injury (direct or indirect-as in tour case) is thought to be the common cause. It often clears on its own. Treatment may be needed in some cases to reduce the inflammation and clear any build-up of fluid. You may find the swelling improves with (R)est, (I)CE packs, (C)compression (wearing a bandage) and (E)elevation (keeping the elbow in a raised position).

For the past week now, I have been getting dizzy, light-headed, my tongue feels like it swells in the back of my throat, my mouth gets dry, I feel like Im going to faint, shaky throughout my body, blurred vision, cold hands & feet... What is going on? And could me not taking my birth control be affecting me?<|eot_id|>",

Welcome to Chat Doctor . I have gone through your query and can understand your concern. As per your complaint it seems that you have a deeply decayed wisdom tooth which has involved the Pulp which is central portion of the tooth and contains nerves and blood vessels and irritation and inflammation of the nerves leads to severe pain which can radiate to Jaw, Ear,and Head. Painkillers may or may not provide you relief, and you need to consult a dentist and get an x Ray done and in case of deep infection you can be advised Root Canal Treatment followed by antibiotics and painkillers if tooth is in a condition to be saved. But in case if tooth cannot be saved due to excessive decay, or you do not want to save the tooth Extraction followed by antibiotics and painkillers will relieve. You need not fear the dentist as all the treatment will be carried out under local anesthesia and will be painless. As for now you can take Tramadol as it can relieve severe pain but should not take for extended duration as it can cause addiction. Hope this information helps. Thanks and regards.

To answer your question, the lungs of premature baby are very poorly developed (technically very less surfactant) -so the baby can breathe for a few minutes to some hours maybe, but then the cardiopulmonary system gives up, and the baby succumbs. If the baby is at least a minimum of 650 grams (also depends on various other factors, like lung maturity, developmental assessment of various systems, absence of heart and other gestational developmental problems), the neonatologist may make a judgmental decision, after discussion with the parents, to give assisted care, till baby reaches term.

I have quite a bit of pain in the last back tooth on the right side (which technically also may have been suffering the same problem as the one taken originally) but my main concern now is 1) there is a bubble/bump formed on the side of my cheek directly parallel to the remaining tooth.. 2)my cheek is still swollen.. so much so that I have difficulty smiling.. and 3) the back tooth is extremely sore when it is touched, any kind of liquid including the warm salt water solution I rinse with causes extreme pain... when the tooth was extracted it needed to be sectioned.. the dentist gave me MANY shots of local including atleast one that actually numbed my lower jaw (where some of my swelling is now) I would also wager a guess that my bump/sore is in the same general area where he was probably applying the needles.. it may also be that the remaining tooth could be rubbing up against it causing a very bad canker sore?? but the swelling is what really concerns me... I believe it could be infected as the dentist and the er doctor said, they thought it could be drainage.. the original reason I had the tooth taken was a bad taste coming from between the 2 teeth.. which was originally caused by trauma.. going to see the dentist tomorrow morning but I would really like to hear another opinion about this.. why is my cheek swollen all the way down to the jaw line when I had an upper tooth taken... 6 whole days ago... it was swollen to the point that my hair follicles were visible, looked like goosebumps.. what can I do to get back to feeling normal again<|eot_id|>",

During the time frame 24 to 48 hours after your surgery, any swelling that's been triggered by the tissue trauma created by the extraction process should have come to a peak. Once it has, you can bring this swelling down more quickly via the application of warm, moist compresses.<|eot_id|>"

Let her first offload her weight from tail bone...let her sit on soft surface or over a Tyre like structure with Hole in the center... Apply a lot of ice over the painful area frequently...

From the symptoms you have described, the pain may be coming from your spine or the hip. Pain associated with hip movement that increases on weight-bearing is more likely related to hip problems. Pain associated with tingling, numbness and radiation along the leg is commonly of neurological origin coming from spine. These are general associations and in your particular case to find out whether the pain is coming from hip or spine a detailed clinical examination is needed.

Thanks for your query and an elucidated history. The most probable cause of the pain on coughing in the belly button area is either a sprain in the muscles in this area, or tear or a hernia. This is best diagnosed by an examination done by a General Surgeon. Ultrasonography may or may not help unless the Radiologist knows what to see. Once a proper diagnosis has been made the treatment will be according to the exact problem. If sprain or so, muscle relaxant, anti-inflammatory medicines, complete bed-rest and of course the most important is the control of the cough. Take products with codeine which needs a prescription as this will control cough as well as the pain. Take laxatives to avoid strain at passing bowel movement. Hormonal changes at menopause have indirect effect as the psychological overlay causes more pains, stress, anxiety adding to the already existing problems.

This change in color, known as \"post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation,\" can happen due to the inflammation from the infection. 😊 It's great that you're using an antifungal like clotrimazole, as it's effective for treating ringworm and other fungal skin issues. Continuing the antifungal cream for at least a week after symptoms resolve is a good practice to ensure the infection is fully cleared. 🌟 \n\nAlways feel free to reach out to a healthcare professional if you have any questions or need further guidance.

The darkened color of the skin where the ringworm was could be due to the inflammation caused by the infection. This is a known medical phenomenon called \\\"post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation\\\".

This could indeed be an allergic reaction, but it's important to rule out other causes as well. 😊 \n\nI recommend consulting your doctor for a thorough examination and possibly some tests, like a complete blood count and inflammation tests, to check for any infections. In the meantime, it might be wise to stop taking lisinopril and keep an eye on your blood pressure, as changes in your medication can affect it. \n\nTake care, and I hope you find relief soon! 💙<|eot_id|>",

I would recommend consulting with your attending physician for a careful physical exam and some tests (complete blood count and inflammation tests for a possible infection). Meanwhile, I would recommend stopping lisinopril intake and closely monitoring your blood pressure (high blood pressure can occur from this change in your therapy). Hope to have been helpful!

If you're overweight, focusing on weight loss can be beneficial since fatty liver is often reversible with the right diet and lifestyle changes. \n\nContinue with your prescribed medications, as it may take 10-12 months to see improvements. Staying active is key, so try to incorporate more movement into your daily routine. Opt for healthier cooking oils like olive or canola oil, limit red meat and high-fat dairy, and increase your intake of fruits and vegetables. Reducing salt and avoiding fried or junk food can also make a big difference. \n\nIncorporating activities like walking, exercise, meditation, and yoga can help you feel better both physically and mentally. Remember to take care of your stress levels, as this can impact your health too. You’re on the right path, and with time and effort, you can improve your condition.

It's important to know that while CKD is a serious condition that affects kidney function, there are ways to manage it and improve your quality of life. 😊\n\nDialysis is indeed a key treatment when kidney function decreases significantly, as it helps remove toxins from your body. However, it's not a cure; instead, it supports your health and well-being. It's good that you're monitoring your blood pressure, as managing it is crucial in CKD. If your blood pressure is consistently above 140/90, adjusting your medication as suggested can help. \n\nFinding the underlying cause of your CKD is also essential, and working closely with your healthcare provider can guide you in the right direction. Considering a kidney transplant in the future is a positive step to think about, as it could offer a more permanent solution. \n\nRemember, you're not alone in this journey, and there are options available to help you manage your condition. Stay strong and keep communicating with your healthcare team for the best support. 💙<|eot_id|>",

When kidney function decrease less than 30% then dialysis is the mainstay of treatment to wash out the toxic products. But dialysis is not the cure of this disease. In fact, dialysis only helps to improve your quality of life and decrease the morbidity. According to your description, you are too young to develop this disease. Generally this disease occurs in some high risks like Diabetes, Hypertension, connective tissue disorders. As your blood pressure is high but CKD itself leads to high blood pressure, so your medication is good according to your disease. If BP is more than 140/90 then increase your Tab Armin 0.1 mg thrice a day. So there will be two approaches. First to manage regular dialysis to keep your serum creatinine lower side along with improved quality of life. Second is to find out the exact cause for CKD in this young age and treatment according to that. And for future, if possible then think of kidney transplant also for permanent treatment or in your word for cure of this disease. Thank you<|eot_id|>"

If your doctor has diagnosed you with acute appendicitis, the most effective treatment is usually emergency surgery, especially after routine tests like blood and urine tests.\n\nWhile some doctors may use antibiotics to manage the infection, this approach can carry risks, including complications like perforation.

Appendicitis is more of a clinical diagnosis and sonogram may be a corroborative investigation in arriving at the diagnosis. However, once you are being examined by your treating doctor and the sonogram also shows that you have got acute appendicitis, then the right treatment for this condition is emergency surgery after doing all other routine investigations like blood and urine test. Not infrequently some physician treat this with antibiotics to control the infection without surgery, but this carries the risk of perforation and other complications related to appendix and so I as a surgeon would not advise you for the same. The Blood Pressure checked for you does not need any treatment for the time being as the upper (systolic) level could be due to the pain in abdomen. The vibration in your body is also not related to your present symptoms of pain abdomen. This might be due to the anxiety factor if no other neurological problem is faced by you. I would suggest you to consult a general surgeon at the earliest for management of acute appendicitis. Wishing you an early recovery.<|eot_id|>"

This is likely due to an infection around your impacted wisdom tooth. Wisdom teeth often don’t have enough space to emerge properly, leading to impaction and potential infection, especially since they are located at the back of the mouth. \n\nThe most effective way to address this issue is through surgery, which is generally safe and can provide lasting relief. It's a common misconception that this type of surgery can affect your eyesight; that's not the case. 😊 \n\nI encourage you to consult with an oral and maxillofacial surgeon who can provide the best care for your situation. Take care of yourself, and I hope you find relief soon! 💙<|eot_id|>",

The reason of infection around it is due to improper cleaning as it is the posterior most area. The only permanent treatment for it is the surgery.also it's just a taboo that surgery may affect your eyesight.  The impaction surgery is very safe, and please feel free to visit an oral and maxillofacial surgeon for the same.take care.thank you<|eot_id|>"

The bruise on your breast may just be an indicator of a small vein burst. It is not a normal presentation of breast cancer. You may want to consider the tests for the bra 1 and bra 2 genes.

The key is ensuring that your free T4 levels are normal, as this is what provides the necessary hormone for your baby's healthy development. As long as your thyroid medication is adjusted correctly, your baby should be just fine. Monitoring your T4 levels is indeed crucial, and your endocrinologist will likely check them regularly throughout your pregnancy, as many women need increased thyroid hormone as their pregnancy progresses.\n\nThere's no need to worry right now; with the right care, you can absolutely have a healthy pregnancy. Wishing you all the best for the journey ahead! 💙<|eot_id|>",

I first want to reassure you that women can and do have healthy pregnancies with thyroid disease all the time. In the case of someone like you, whose thyroid has been essentially destroyed by RAI, your TSH will frequently be high. But as long as your free T4 is normal (which is the actual level of your circulating thyroid hormone) the baby will receive enough hormone for normal healthy development. So as long as your supplemental thyroid medication is at the correct level, your baby will be fine.  It is more important to monitor your thyroid hormone level by the T4 value, however, rather than the TSH. Your endocrinologist likely will check your level every month or two during the pregnancy as most women need more thyroid hormone as the away grows. So in summary, there is nothing to be concerned about right now, and under the right care you should absolutely be able to have a healthy pregnancy. I hope this answer was helpful and reassuring.

I can understand your concern. You are having stomach problem with shortness of breath. So possibility of HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) induced bronchitis is more. HERD is known risk factor for bronchitis. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment of bronchitis is based on severity only. You may need inhaled bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS).

This suggests a very minimal risk of pregnancy.\n\nHowever, at 47 years old, it's important to recognize that you may be experiencing premenopausal changes, which can make ovulation unpredictable and your cycles irregular. This can complicate understanding your fertile window. During this time, using reliable contraception, like condoms, is advisable to prevent unintended pregnancy.\n\nWhile it seems unlikely that you are pregnant, if your period does not arrive by November 26, it would be a good idea to take a pregnancy test with your first morning urine. Remember, consulting with a healthcare professional can provide you with personalized advice and support. You're doing great by staying informed about your body! 💙<|eot_id|>",

In regular menstrual cycle, the egg is released 14 days prior to the next expected menses. The Egg has a life of 24 hours while sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence, a period of about a week around the day of egg release is fertile period. Considering your period of about 28 days, your expected period was around 14 November and the day of egg release (ovulation) would be around 31 October. This calculates fertile period from 27 October to 4 November. Thus, your unprotected intercourse on 10 November falls way outside the fertile period. Thus, according to this calculation, you carry very minimal risk of pregnancy due to this intercourse. However, we have to consider your age factor. Your age is 47 years; nearing menopause. Variation in your menstrual pattern is due to the premenopausal changes. During this period of life, the ovulation is very unpredictable and irregular. Not all the cycles are ovulatory. Moreover, the menses also may become irregular. Thus, it really becomes difficult to calculate the safe period. Even if your menses are delayed, you cannot figure out whether these are premenopausal irregularities or possibility of pregnancy. Hence, during this phase of life, it is always advisable to use reliable contraceptive like condom. I feel, with this menstrual history and history of intercourse, you stand very minimal, almost no chance of pregnancy. You should get your menses. However, if at all you do not get menses even 40 days after the last menstrual period; i.e. 26 November, perform pregnancy test on overnight first morning urine sample. I hope this helps you.<|eot_id|>"

This can be a significant factor in secondary infertility. 😊 \n\nIrregular periods can also be influenced by your weight. Being overweight or underweight can disrupt your menstrual cycles and affect ovulation. Extreme exercise and dieting can further complicate this. If weight is a factor, achieving a healthier balance through a nutritious diet and moderate exercise may help regulate your cycles and improve your chances of conceiving naturally. \n\nAlways consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and support.

Get a SG done to see if tubes are functioning properly because many a times secondary infertility can be associated with this. Another possible cause of irregular periods -- being overweight, or underweight, can cause a disruption in your menstrual cycles. Both being overweight, and underweight, can also cause an ovulation. Extreme exercise and extreme dieting are more potential causes of irregular cycles. In this case, losing weight may be enough to regulate your cycles again, increasing the chances of getting pregnant naturally. If extreme dieting is the problem, changing your diet to a more balanced plan, and even gaining some weight if you're underweight, can help regulate your cycles. Bbyeee<|eot_id|>"

My brother is a 26-year-old Mentally handicapped individual with some SERIOUS health issues going on and noone can come up with anything, which has now left him oxygen dependent and on Lasix to keep fluid off his lung and heart, and no signs of getting any better. Let me start from the beginning as I believe this is all linked someway somehow. About 4 months ago, my brother presented with severe leg swelling on one leg from knee to ankle. My parents took him to Dr, and they treated him with infection from a scratch on his leg. The swelling did not get better and he was having troubles walking. Please keep in mind that all his symptoms have been observed as due to his mental challenges, he never tells us when anything is wrong, without much prodding, (life is good in his eyes) . My parents took him back and they tested him and the sore on his leg had MRSA , therefore they started treating him for MRSA. Again he did not get better, and the finally did a ultrasound of his leg to discover he had a severe DVT from the knee to the ankle. He was therefore put on blood thinners which the DVT eventually did resolve and they were going to keep him on blood thinners for 6 months then take him off and do further testing to see what may have caused this in such a young, active young man. Then at the end of June my parents noticed he was having trouble breathing. When they asked him what was wrong, he said nothing initially, and as they observed him longer they realized he was really struggling to breathe. Therefore, they took him to the ER, and discovered he had a pericardial and pleural effusion . They drained the fluid and ran cytology tests on it whicChatDoctore back negative, but the color of the fluid was milky. They also created a pericardial window to drain the fluid off his heart. His white count was elevated and initially he had blood and high protein in his urine as well, which later cleared. They sent him home on a Sunday. Within 2 days he could not even get out of bed without heavy breathing and again he thought he was okay, so they took him back to the doctor. They did a chest x-ray to discover he had a massive effusion in his chest already. He was admitted and due to the severity they had to put a chest tube in each side and be had to be intubated to keep his oxygen levels up. They drained 2 L of fluid off one lung and 1 L off the other. His white count was elevated. They began running more tests on his heart, from echo to ultrasounds to many other tests. This showed his heart was working extra hard to pump. Eventually he stabilized was extubated still with tubes draining a lot, and they did an MR of his heart which showed his pericardium was thickened to 9 mm. They thought they would have to perform a pericardiectomy due to constrictive pericarditis . They did a heart cath to verify and it showed that his heart was constricted, and by the time they did the cath, his heart actually was pumping ok. The pericardium was still obviously thickened and showed some abnormalities; however was not constricting the heart, so they did not perform the pericardiectomy. They could not pull the chest tubes though as he was still putting out a lot of fluid, but now was clear, with a bloody-tinge. At this time his white counts started dropping as well as his hemoglobin. They ran several blood tests and discovered he was extremely protein malnourished (which is hard to believe as my brother is 6 foot 3 inches and weighs 300+ pounds). He was also severe anemia and had very low lymphocytes, monocytes. They tried iron supplementation and discovered this was making his iron levels worse. They even tried IV iron and still made his iron levels lower therefore they discontinued the iron. He was taking protein shakes for the protein, and this helped stabilize his protein levels. They also did a CT scan of his abdomen and discovered he has splenomegaly. His liver function tests were normal. His CRP and Sed rate were elevated. At this time, they transferred him to a higher level of care as they could not figure out what was going on with him. The University Medical Center ran even more tests, and said everytime they ran a test they ended up with more questions than answers. They were sure it was some kind of inflammatory condition such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis as my mom has rheumatoid; however all these tests came back negative. Rheumatology signed off on his case saying it was not a rheumatologic condition. The fluid eventually slowed in his lungs and they pulled one tube and then the next. He still requires at least 2 L of oxygen via nasal cannula, but hospital had to send him home as that was his only requirement and insurance would not allow him to stay longer. One week after discharge of being in hospital for nearly 3 weeks total, he is still protein malnourished with anemia. His white cells are still extremely low. They ran immunoglobulin tests on him and discovered they were nearly non-existent. Therefore between his low white count and immunoglobulins, he has no immune system. His lungs have began filling up again in his lungs, and therefore the doctor put him on Lasix to help get rid of fluid. We will not know until next week if this seems to be helping. My parents believe it is helping with his breathing however his ankles are still swelling. He is still requiring his Oxygen. He also had a bone marrow test done, this came back negative for cancers. However, they did say they are still waiting for the iron studies of the bone marrow, but I am not sure what that will really show, except his iron deficiency. Everyone is at a loss as to what is going on. None has any answers and every doctor keeps passing the buck to another and now we are back to his primary care, which I am not confident at all he can handle this. To me it seems this is above so many doctors heads, we need to know where to go. We are treating symptoms as he is now on blood pressure medicines and a medicine to keep his heart rate down as it gets too high, and oxygen and Lasix. This is a 26-year-old, how can he live like this for life. There has to be someone who can help us. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, or anything we can suggest they test for. Obviously this is something rare no one has seen, so we just need to get to the right doctor or someone who has seen this before and can help.<|eot_id|>",

Anemia can indeed be a cause for those symptoms, as it involves low hemoglobin levels. The most common reasons for anemia are dietary deficiencies in iron and folic acid, though there are rare genetic causes as well. 🌟 \n\nIt's a good idea to start with a complete blood count (CBC) and tests for serum iron and folic acid levels. These will help determine if you have anemia. If those levels are low, iron and folic acid supplements might be recommended. If your CBC comes back normal, stress and anxiety could be contributing to your symptoms.

Both these days fall in safe period. The egg release takes place 14 days prior to next expected period. The egg has a life of 24 hours while the sperms are active for 72 hours. Hence, a period of about one week around the day of egg release is considered as fertile period. The chances of pregnancy are very high if the intercourse is performed in this period. Your both sessions of intercourses were far away from this period. So there is no chance that you are pregnant. Moreover, you already have started having spotting. So you will get menses in few days.

A thorough neurological assessment is advised. Along with MRI of brain. As you are having tingling sensation in the ears it could be related to the vestibular system and for this an MRI of the brain is advised. Also, the heaviness in the base of the skull is due to tension headache, which can be due to stress or may be muscle tension. For which a thorough neurological assessment is advised. Also undergoing physical therapy for neck region and vestibular rehabilitation should help you avoid such symptoms which you are facing now. In my clinical practice most patients responds well to physical therapy and vestibular rehabilitation. RegardsJay In Chat Doctor.<|eot_id|>"

Normal levels typically range from 5 to 40 IU/L, and elevated levels can indicate conditions like fatty liver or viral hepatitis.\n\nGiven your history of jaundice and fever, it's wise to be cautious, as there may be a risk of developing liver issues again. Consulting a gastroenterologist for a thorough evaluation would be a great step to ensure your health is monitored closely. \n\nTake care, and remember that seeking professional guidance is always a positive move! 💙<|eot_id|>",

You must follow your blood thinner medicines.  Regular PT, INR report should be done to titrate blood thinner medicine. 2. Make sure your doctor is giving cortisone in the joint and not in the vessels. Intra-articular steroid injection is treatment of chronic joint pain.

Alopecia errata is autoimmune condition where there is a sudden loss of hair in an area in scalp.Most of the times it is self limiting recovering in about 6 months, but when it is spreading it is little worry.

You can discuss these things with your dermatologist. You may continue with steroid lotion along with minoxidil 5% and tacrolimus ointment. Palmoplantar psoriasis is recalcitrant condition, Since you have disease since 10 years you can go for calcitriol ointment, also methotrexate therapy can help you.

I understand your concern. You shouldn't worry too much. You scheduled for CT which men that it's not an urgency to do it. As a general rule prior to do a d dimer it's been done a prediction score for the risk of pulmonary embolus. I'm convinced that your doctor is suspecting pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary embolic are clots that normal are formed in the veins of lower extremity that travel and block pulmonary arteries. As I see you don't have any pain in the limbs which is a good thing and lowers the risk that you might have thrombus in the lower extremities. You have had a biopsy of your thyroid but the results of biopsy are not shown. It's a great importance to know the results of it. The biopsy may be related to these high d dimer. Periods general do not increase the d dimer The cases for high D dimer excluding the clot formation include infection which increases dimer at high level. Age, whit hit increases somehow and some other causes like pregnancy, trauma, surgery. You just have to wait, and I know is not easy to stay with fear, but a CT is going to be performed and a diagnosis hopeful will come and things can go for better. Wish you good health<|eot_id|>"

Given your symptoms, it seems like there might be some soft tissue injury as well.\n\nTo help with the swelling and pain, strapping your finger for support and using a crepe bandage can be beneficial. Ice packs can also help reduce inflammation and provide relief. Physiotherapy, including ultrasound and TENS, may support your healing process.\n\nFor additional support, you might consider taking supplements like Tab Colin [it C] and an antioxidant with anti-inflammatory properties like Tab Enzymic Plus. If you don’t see improvement, it’s important to consult a healthcare professional again.\n\nTake care of yourself, and I hope you feel better soon! 💙 If you have more questions, feel free to reach out.<|eot_id|>",

I also started rock climbing about a year ago.  I am not sure if this pain is caused by climbing... but I dont think its connected.  I was anorexic for about 2 yrs. in college.  Since then, I have been healthy - no blood pressure issues.  I told my primary care physician about his in September, and he attributed my heart pain to muscle issues.  I am still having it, however.  Also, I recently have had a lot of left shoulder pain (had left elbow tendonitis last year) and my left middle finger has been numb at the tip for about 2 weeks.  This could be a pinched nerve, in my opinion, but Im getting a little concerned since its all on my left side and Im still getting this heart pain.  Any thoughts?<|eot_id|>",

It's important to rule out any cardiac issues first, as these symptoms can sometimes be related to heart conditions. Getting an ECG, a 2D echocardiogram, and a stress test is a good starting point. If those tests come back normal, it’s possible that stress and anxiety could be contributing to how you feel. 😊 \n\nTaking steps to manage stress is important. Finding ways to relax and perhaps speaking with a psychiatrist for counseling could be very helpful. Identifying the sources of stress in your life and working on solutions can make a big difference. \n\nRemember, you’re not alone in this, and with the right support, you can feel better.

I can understand your concern. In my opinion, we should first rule out cardiac cause for your symptoms because left sided chest pain and shoulder discomfort are more associated with heart diseases. So get done ECG, 2d echo and stress test (trade mill test) first. If all these are normal then no need to worry about heart diseases. Sometimes, stress and anxiety can also cause similar symptoms. So avoid stress and tension, be relaxed and calm. Consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in your life and start working on its solution. You may need anxiolytic Chat Doctor.  Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. But first rule out heart diseases. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

This is a natural physiological response to breastfeeding. 😊 If you're feeling uncomfortable with your breast size after this period, there are options available, such as breast reduction surgery or liposuction.

I can understand your situation and problem. By your history and description, possibility of pleuritic chest pain is more. And it is seen commonly with lung infection and bronchitis. You are also having cough and difficulty on breathing so possibility of bronchitis and lung infection is high. You also had flu infection. And this can also cause bronchitis and lung infection. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, chest x-ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). Chest x-ray is needed to rule out lung infection. PFT is needed for the diagnosis of bronchitis. You may need inhaled bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and antibiotics. So better to first diagnose yourself and then start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. Wish you good health. Thanks.<|eot_id|>"

Thanks for writing to us at Chat Doctor The Chat Doctor. Seborrhea dermatitis is an inflammatory condition of the skin which classically involves areas rich in sebaceous glands like scalp, face (eyebrows, glabella, nasolabial folds, chin etc.) and chest/pre-sternal area. Itching is usually a symptom. If I was the treating doctor I would have asked you to apply a mild to moderately potent topical steroid e.g. demonize 0.05%, twice daily for a few days. Seborrheic dermatitis is a steroid responsive condition and steroids bring immense improvement in this condition. Since seborrhea dermatitis can recur therefore it is important to be on a maintenance regime to sustain the improvement achieved with topical steroid. Topical immunomodulators such as tacrolimus Or pimecrolimus are effective in maintaining the improvement achieved with topical steroids. This is all the more important because steroids cannot be used on face forever I would suggest that you visit a dermatologist in your region for a confirmatory diagnosis. Your dermatologist may ask you to use a topical steroid initially for a short duration of 2 weeks and thereafter may taper them to once daily Or alternate day application before finally with<|eot_id|>"

It's true that they can be caused by anxiety or stress, but they might also indicate something like supraventricular tachycardia. 😊 To get a clear diagnosis, an ECG during the episode is really important.

It can be normal sinus tachycardia due to anxiety or stress, or it could be abnormal supra ventricular tachycardia. For the diagnosis, you need to do ECG at the time of palpitation & tachycardia. If the duration of palpitations are short enough to reach a nearby hospital, we put a 24hr ECG monitoring (Holder Monitor). You also need to do a 2D Echo & thyroid function test to see for any associated abnormality if any. Looking at your symptoms, you also seem to have gastritis.

This may be the reason of delayed conception for your mother-in-law. Same reason may be in your case also, but before any judgement your husband must be examined for SEMEN analysis.

Keeping her hydrated with warm fluids and using saltwater gargles can provide additional relief. \n\nIf she's wheezing, nebulizing can be a good option to help open her airways.

It's important to recognize that osteoarthritis often results from the natural aging process. 😊 \n\nFocusing on reducing inflammation and pain is key, and physiotherapy plays a crucial role in this. It not only strengthens the muscles around the knee but also helps protect the bones from rubbing against each other, which can lead to pain. Strengthening these muscles can boost confidence in mobility, making daily activities easier and more enjoyable. \n\nWhile analgesics can be useful for managing acute pain, exploring exercise and physical therapy is a wonderful approach to managing osteoarthritis. Natural remedies can vary in effectiveness, so it's always best to consult with healthcare professionals about what might work for you. \n\nIt's also good to know that inflammation from osteoarthritis is unlikely to affect the heart and brain. Making some lifestyle adjustments, like minimizing stair climbing or squatting, can also help manage symptoms. \n\nStay positive and keep moving forward; there are many supportive options available! 💙<|eot_id|>",

Combating inflammation knee osteoarthritis in elderly can be tough, but not impossible. First you have to understand that osteoarthritis mainly arises due to normal degenerative processes that occur with ones aging. So the best way to reduce inflammation and pain is to reduce the factors that cause them. The most important aspect of the treatment that I prescribe to my patients is physiotherapy. Not only does it strengthen the qua Chat Doctor.  Secondly if the muscles are strengthened the surface of the bones that rub against each other and cause pain in osteoarthritis are less prone to do so and the further rate of degeneration comes down. Analgesics can help control acute flares. But like you, I prefer less of allopathic treatment for osteoarthritis and more of exercises. With their muscles becoming stronger they become more confident of ambulating around the house as well. I am not very certain of the extent natural remedies and alternative medicines can help.  And rest assured that inflammation arising in osteoarthritis is least likely to affect the heart and brain. There is no correlation. Some lifestyle changes like avoiding too much of climbing stairs or squatting can be avoided.<|eot_id|>"

We asked for more than one medical opinion regarding his treatment and basically we have two options; the first is to conduct several extensive chemotherapy sessions and then switch to radiotherapy or surgery. The second was that his condition was very rare that it can be treated by surgery first and then less sessions of chemotherapy can be conducted. I know that the immunity for a person gets very low after having chemotherapy and I am really concerned of him having chemotherapy first and surgery afterwards, so I want to ask which of the two options is a better one? And whether there are any other options for treatment?

The worry with group B streptococcus(GBS) is that if present in pregnant women especially during the last few weeks it can be transmitted to the baby during delivery and can cause infection in baby called meningitis and septicemia which are quite serious. So, you need to take antibiotics in labor through the intravenous route to prevent the transmission of these bacteria to your baby. The usual antibiotic given is penicillin, but if you are allergies an alternative is given. It would be advisable to take antibiotic for the strep b infection now also, and you could consider taking it with a local antifungal cream for the thrush, especially if you have grouped B strep in your urine culture. Do remember to repeat strep b culture at 36 weeks, and please inform your obstetrician that you have had this infection during this pregnancy, to make sure you get intrapartum antibiotics to prevent transmission of bacteria to your baby.

I can understand your situation and problem. COPD is chronic progressive disease. In end stages it can cause systemic complications like Right sided heart failure, left sided heart failure, pulmonary edema, fluid overload, hypotension and renal shut down. So for her symptoms like ascites (water in stomach), water coming from nose and mouth (pulmonary edema) can be due to Either heart failure or fluid overload due to renal shutdown. Since she is already in hospice care, there is nothing much we can do. But these are not good signs for her. She is going towards end stage disease. Better to accept the fate.<|eot_id|>"

Cancer is a challenging condition and requires long time treatment and support. Since you are having an ileostomy, there is a chance that scar tissue is present after surgery and radiation and this is causing the discomfort in passing normal bowel movements. You have also had an intestinal obstruction and given regular enemas and laxatives. It is suggested that you take foods rich in dietary fibers and this will cause better stool formation and reduce chances of constipation. Early in the morning you can have a glass of warm water as you wake up and this can stimulate early morning bowel movements. You can eat small meals at shorter intervals in place of less frequent large meals. Reduce the amount of oils in your food. Please do not worry.<|eot_id|>"

In my opinion you may add some muscle relaxants and steroid intramuscular injections and some anticonvulsant that helps you sleep easier with lesser pain attacks. Neck exercises like extension, retraction, shoulder retraction, and isometric hold are highly suggestive in such cases. You may ask your neurosurgeon for further evaluation to recommend you the required dosing according to your condition. Sometimes a surgical solution is better especially after 6 months of treatment by physiotherapy and medications. Spinal surgeons can remove just the protruding portion of the disk. Rarely, however, the entire disk must be removed. In these cases, the vertebrae may need to be fused together with metal hardware to provide spinal stability. Rarely, your surgeon may suggest the implantation of an artificial disk. Please click on THANK YOU and consider a 5-star rating with some positive feedback if the information was helpful.

I can understand your friends situation and problem. He is having chest pain on swallowing and lying down, and not improving with painkiller (ibuprofen) so possibility of HERD related pain is more. HERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms. Lying down position makes reflux easier. So better to keep 2-3 pillows under head in the bed to prevent reflux. Ask him to avoid painkiller Chat Doctor.  Start proton pump inhibitors (antacid).  Ask him to avoid stress and tension, avoid hot and spicy food, avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. Ask him to quit smoking and alcohol if he has these habits. He will mostly improve with all these. If not improving than consult gastroenterologist and get done upper GI (gastrointestinal) copy. Hope I have solved your query.

I would like to clarify to you, that as long as the test is positive, there is high risk of the future pregnancy getting affected by rubella as well as CMV virus. Risk of congenital malformations is very high. You should not conceive as long the results of tests turn negative. Consider having TORCH TEST next time when you check your blood liters.

I ve had sexually intercourse with 2 different partners. Also my ballsack was really dry and looked kind of cracked. My penis and ballsack was like that for about 2 days. After those 2 days I noticed that there was a wet spot that smelled fishy on the underside of penis. I washed it in the shower but the next day the smell and the spot was back. I washed it tonight but this time it turned red and looks as if some skin peeled off. The spot is sensitive to touch. I m really scared. Do you know what it is?<|eot_id|>",

Additionally, incorporating relaxation techniques into your routine may help reduce stress on your heart. \n\nA stress test could also provide more insights into your heart's condition.

I am Chat Doctor. Read your query. That is a very significant question and I appreciate your problem. I will try my best to answer your querulous reports are normal to a large extent. However, your echocardiography does suggest VH or left ventricular hypertrophy. This usually happens when your heart is pumping blood against a resistance to the flow of blood. It is usually a feature of hypertension, but you have mentioned a normal blood pressure.However, you have also indicated that you have a type A personality- anxiety and stress. This may be causing an undue load on the heart. I would seriously suggest that you meet a local doc to prescribe you a medicine from the group of ACE-I or Arms. And do try relaxation techniques. To really make sure all is fine with the heart, you may want to try a stress test-treadmill/dobutamine. I hope this helps you. Inform the reports mentioned above so I can be of help further. Best of luck. I have given you the answer to the maximum considering the information provided. The results of the tests could further enhance my answer to you.

Cabergoline is indeed a good choice and can help improve her hormone levels, which is essential for regular ovulation. \n\nThe mildly elevated prolactin level is manageable, and with the right treatment, it can return to normal, increasing the chances of conception. The presence of pus cells in the semen suggests an infection, which can be treated with antibiotics, so addressing that is important too. \n\nIt's completely understandable to feel worried, but both of your conditions are correctable, and many couples successfully conceive after treatment.

In my opinion you are on correct line of treatment. Your wife has problems of hypothyroidism and galactorrhea both are the cause of female infertility. They might cause hormonal imbalance leading to irregular ovulation and irregular cycles. Cabgoline is better than bromicriptine and increases the conception chances. Cabgoline is given as tapering dose and the prolactin level is repeated after the course. The prolactin level is only mildly elevated.(up to 20\\u00a0ng/ml is taken as normal). But both the problems are correctable and once the level becomes normal the conception becomes successful. Presence of pus cells in semen indicate infection, and it needs a course of antibiotics to be taken. Nothing to worry. Avoid stress. As both your and your partners problems are correctable and reversible. There are good chances of pregnancy once they are corrected. Hope this helps. Best regards....<|eot_id|>"

It's important to note that fluid in the abdomen can indicate an underlying issue, but it may also be related to a ruptured follicle if it coincides with her ovulation period, which typically occurs about 14 days before her next expected period. 😊\n\nIf she remains asymptomatic in the next few days, it’s likely not a cause for alarm, and a follow-up ultrasound can help monitor the situation. However, if the fluid doesn’t resolve, further tests such as blood, urine, and stool analysis may be necessary, and a diagnostic laparoscopy could be considered to explore the cause more closely. Other potential causes to be aware of in a 13-year-old include appendicitis or infections like tuberculosis or primary peritonitis.\n\nIt's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and to ensure your daughter receives the appropriate care.

Thanks for your query. Yes, small fluid in the Cul-de-sac has to be bothered about as the age of your daughter is just 13, and we do not get fluids in the abdomen unless there is a problem. It may be a fluid from the ruptured follicle as you are right suspecting, if the dates are coinciding with possible ovulation period, which is normally 14 days prior to the next expected period. If she gets asymptomatic within a few days nothing to worry; you can follow up the fluid with simple ultrasonography. If the condition does not resolve, she will need further studies including the tests of blood, urine and stool and if required Diagnostic Laparoscopy for seeing the interior of the stomach, and to get the fluid for analysis to find the probable cause. The other causes in a child of 13 years can be appendicitis, tuberculosis, primary peritonitis. And so on.<|eot_id|>"

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) can be quite common, and E. coli is indeed one of the most frequent causes. 😊 It's good to know that with the right antibiotics, UTIs can be effectively treated. However, untreated infections can lead to complications, so it's important to follow your treatment plan.\n\nStaying well-hydrated with plenty of fluids, around 3 liters a day, and drinking cranberry juice can help prevent future UTIs. Remember to complete your course of antibiotics and consider getting a urine test afterward to ensure the infection is cleared. \n\nYou're taking the right steps, and it's important to keep in touch with your healthcare provider throughout this process. Take care! 💙<|eot_id|>",

In my opinion the urinary infection is caused by organism called E.cold. Urinary tract infections (UTI) are commonly seen in pregnancy. Among them the E.cold is the most common organism causing UTI. Nothing to worry. As by taking appropriate antibiotics course the UTI can be treated. But the untreated UTI might cause uterine irritability leading to preterm pains. Take adequate fluids up to 3 liters per day and cranberry juice to prevent UTI. Because deny Chat Doctor. As such nothing to worry. I suggest you to finish the course of antibiotics. Also get a urine examination done after finishing the antibiotic course to ensure the clearance of infection. Hope this helps. Best regards...<|eot_id|>"

I wish to inform you that there is no treatment in Ayurveda that can treat blockages in the heart arteries. Your brother is young and has blockages involving all the three arteries of the heart (triple vessel disease). He is prone to cardiac complications if surgery is not done. Any cardiac episode like a heart attack can decrease his heart pumping function and will considerably affect his quality of life. Please do not waste time looking for alternative Ayurveda treatment because it is simply not going to help. I have seen patients do very well after bypass surgery. Open-heart surgery is very well tolerated by patients, and they usually have a good quality of life. A bypass graft remains patent for 15-20 years. I have also seen patients who were reluctant to undergo a bypass surgery when it was the right time and later suffer. My opinion is to go ahead firmly with the decision of a bypass surgery. Wishing him good health. Regards<|eot_id|>"

So short term relief is there. Newer inhaled bronchodilators like long acting beta 2 agonist(LAB) with inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) are preferred now. Their action last for 10-12 hours.

I understand your concern.  The meaning of the USG readings are- 1. Fetal movements adequate... it indicates normal fetal movements... the fetus is in good health (no effects of nuclei cords on baby. While USG scan was done 2. Placenta is anterior (It is attached to front wall of uterus & it is not low-lying(It is in safe place-so no risk of placenta prefix- causing risk in delivery) 3. Nuclei cord twice- Nuclei cord means cord around neck of fetus... Here baby has 2 rounds of placenta around neck.  4. Cervix is competent-Cervix is normal length (shortening of cervix indicates nearing of delivery. ). So here it signifies safety of baby, no risk or delivery these days.  * In all it shows cord around babies neck with two rounds .... Bur baby is not affected, nor there is cervical sign of early labor.  Nuclei cords may get automatically relieved, still we keep a watch on fetal wellbeing & possibility of labor(with cord around neck then becomes a sign of concern) Please show the report to your treating gynecologist for specific advise.  Thanks<|eot_id|>"

Getting an x-ray or CT scan can provide valuable information about the bone's condition. 😊 \n\nStarting with low-intensity exercises and gradually increasing the intensity over a few months is a smart approach. This helps ensure that the bone is ready to handle more stress and strain.

Poor hygiene can lead to plaque buildup and gingivitis. Regular dental cleanings, or scaling, can help keep your gums healthy.

Jaundice can be caused by many diseases like bile ducts blockage by stones, liver cirrhosis, liver viral infection, blood disorders with hemolysis, pancreas cancer, liver cancer and many more.

Back exercises, neurotrophic such as mecobalamine and analgesics (DICLOFENAC 100 MG SLOW RELEASE TABLETS) give relief. Sometimes vitamin D deficiency can aggravate this so serum vitamin D test is advised if it is lower than vitamin D supplementation will be required. Avoid long continuous standing.

Is there any laxative or stool softener I can take if I need to to stay regular? And I also have 5-500s, is there much difference between the 325 s vs 500 s? Looking for advise. Thank you. vjp<|eot_id|>",

The narcotic component can indeed lead to constipation, while acetaminophen is important for pain relief but should be used cautiously to avoid liver damage. 😊 \n\nConsidering physical therapy, massage, or an epidural block could be beneficial if you're not seeing improvement. It's also wise to get an MRI of your lumbosacral area if it’s been over two years since your last one, as this can provide important information about your condition. \n\nAlways consult with your healthcare provider for personalized advice and to ensure you're making the best decisions for your health.

The 5\\u00a0mg is the narcotic part and 500\\u00a0mg is acetaminophen. The component that gives you constipation is the narcotic part (5\\u00a0mg) for which an increase in acetaminophen dose will give you risk of liver damage but not constipation. I will advise you to try physical or massage therapy and epidural block if no improvement. It depends on the level of damage that you will improve fast or not. If you have not had MRI of lumbosacral in more than 2 years, it is advisable to have it. Chat Doctor.<|eot_id|>"

He said he didn t ejaculate however it was better that i took the pill after it happened to be on the safe side. I took the pill on Monday and have had no side affects or anything since taking it. 10 days before sleeping with my partner i had my period. Is there still a risk that i can still get pregnant even after taking the morning after pill. Help on this matter would be appreciated.<|eot_id|>",

The fertile window typically falls between the 10th and 18th days of a regular 28-day cycle. Since you had intercourse on the 10th day and took the morning-after pill, the chances of conception are quite low. 😊 \n\nThe morning-after pill has a failure rate of about 5%, which means it's not 100% effective. It's important to remember that regular use of emergency contraception isn't recommended. If your period is delayed by a week or two, it would be a good idea to take a pregnancy test. \n\nTake care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out to a healthcare professional for personalized advice! 💙<|eot_id|>",

Fertile period is between 10th day to 18th day in normal regular cycle of 28 day duration. As you had sex on 10th day and taken morning after pill, chances of conception are negligible. Failure rate of morning after pill is 5%. Not completely effective in preventing conception. Regular use of emergency pill is not recommended. If You get delayed periods by a week or 2 get pregnancy test done. Hope this helps you. Regards<|eot_id|>"

Currently, your mothers blood pressure and heart rate are still withing the normal range but on the lower end of it. Typically, pacemakers are implanted because of either low or irregular heart rate, and they frequently require adjustment of their rate after the initial implantation. The purpose of the medication she receives is to slow down the natural heart rate. The best thing to do right now if your mother is presenting symptoms of tiredness and lightheartedness is to interrogate the pacemaker and see whether increasing the pacing rate has any beneficial influence of her. I would attempt not to change the medication dose right now, since I do not know why is she receiving the metoprolol.<|eot_id|>"

It's important to keep an eye on the lymph nodes, noting any changes in size, shape, or consistency. If they decrease in size, further investigation may not be necessary. \n\nGiven your family history of breast cancer, regular clinical breast examinations every three years is a wise choice. Staying proactive about your health is key. Remember to consult with your healthcare professional for personalized advice and support. Take care of yourself! 💙<|eot_id|>",

It's important to know that taking Prozac with Atomoxetine may affect blood pressure and heart rate, and this can vary based on your son's weight and the specific dose of Prozac.\n\nIf you're considering continuing Prozac, it's crucial to consult a healthcare professional who can determine the right dosage for your son. Additionally, there’s a chance that Synthroid could be contributing to his anxiety, and a dosage adjustment might help. Seeking guidance from a child psychiatrist would be a great step forward. You're doing your best for your son, and getting the right support will make a difference. 💙<|eot_id|>",

The fact is that Strategy (Atomoxetine) was prescribed for your sons ADHD (Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder). You state that your son is also taking Synthroid (Levothyroxine), which a replacement for a natural hormone (chemical) that occurs in the body. I will directly answer you question by saying that Prozac (Fluoxetine) when given with Strategy, causes problems in blood pressure and heart rate. This is dependent on the exact dose of Prozac that is given and your sons weight. If you wished to continue Prozac therapy, then you would definitely have to go to a Doctor who would precisely calculate the right dose of Prozac for your son. There is a remote possibility that the Synthroid medication is causing the anxiety response in your son. All your son needs is a dosage adjustment. Kindly seek a child psychiatrist.<|eot_id|>"

Have you been continuously trying since past ten moths or did u give breaks in between? If you tried continuously since all these months, then I'd suggest you to get your scan done for POD, ovarian and uterine physiology along with a detailed checkup for thyroid and other hormones, And blood tests. Your husband also needs to be investigated in details at the same time.  You could come back with all the reports to us, or you can see a doctor, with those reports. Meanwhile, do not lose hope and keep trying, as there is no hard and fast rule for the ratio of success rate to the no. of attempts in this matter. Some couples are first time lucky, and many others take much longer to get that positive on their pregnancy test. Also, don't stress over it, as it hampers one's chances of conceiving. Both you and your husband must follow a healthy lifestyle, that includes a combination of healthy mind, body and soul (exercises, healthy diet and peace of mind). With this, you should also keep in mind the basic pointers like keeping your waist slightly elevated with a pillow after intercourse, and not immediately visiting the toilet etc. All the best!<|eot_id|>"

Dear madam, Looking into your problem I would say that throbbing and prominent veins can be a sign of thrombophlebitis or impending thrombosis.  SHE patients are prone for thrombotic complications, so it could be a sign for that. In my opinion you should consult your doctor at earliest to get yourself evaluated for the disease, get a venous color Doppler done and to look for any signs of thrombosis.

As certain symptoms arise due to medication and contacting the gynecologist for the same should help change the medication. In some cases few medicines do not get adjusted to the physiological of certain individuals and change of medication can help a lot further. Also, during pregnancy there is a high physiological process occurring for the development of the child. This head wobbling can be due to less oxygen reaching the brain and performing Lamaze's exercises will help you to ease the physiological health and also improve the delivery process.

In my opinion the scan report is absolutely normal. In a 2nd and 3rd trimester ultrasound the parameters of baby like BPD(biparietal diameter), FL(femur length), AC(Abdominal circumference) are taken. All these are corresponding to one another around 21-22 weeks. And the AFI(amniotic fluid index) is an indicator of liquor and is adequate. Usually placenta is implanted over the anterior or posterior or funds of uterus and here it is anterior, and the implantation is normal. There are no blood clots associated with it or any blood collection which is suggested by no blood clots, no chorionic haemangioma etc. The cervix is closed and EFA(estimated fetal weight) is around 370+/-50 GMS. Fetal heart rate is 142 /min which is also good. Expected date of delivery(EDD) is June 30 +/- 1 week. Overall the ultrasound report is normal. Maternal abdomen normal means mother abdomen is also normal. Hope this helps. Best regards... Chat Doctor.<|eot_id|>"

Physio, traction, neck crunching in past. 63 yrs female. Take half 25 mg Endep, Imigran and Panadol Osteo. Slow loss of fine motor skills in right hand affecting writing. Hand seizes after 3 letters. FM pain worsened by physical activity (when aching), stress, especially weather changes. Presently have neck pain worsened by tilting head back. Pain worsened by laying on neck in bed at night. At times find that Imigran (Sumatriptan) eases neck pain - does this indicate blood vessel entrapment as action of Imigran seems to ease pain in neck at times, when other medication doesn t do anything. Work in school, which requires twisting, turning etc. Cold winter at present in Adelaide, South Aust which exacerbates pain, although I find repeatedly that my best health and least pain occurs in Autumn every year. Get light-headed and dizzy at times. Fell off a low platform onto knees and fainted 2 years ago + excruciating calf pain at night - got up screaming and fainted. Ultrasound revealed clot, suggested Warfarin immediately. I didn t take, sought further advice, saw Vascular Surg, more bloods taken, then just aspirin at night. Took for a while, but not now - bad press recently. Do not have regular gp. See when need scripts. Medical clinic situation rather than family gp. FM mainly self-management. Was secretary of Arthritis Foundation support group initially and learnt a lot about FM but haven t kept up with latest for a while now. Just push on, but neck pain is very restrictive and has been constant for a month now, with just occasional relief - probably due to pills rather than abating of problem. Don t know whether to ignore and hope it gets better, or get some massage, or go down gp line and seek specialist assessment. Am not one who rushes to doctor as over time fm patients usually learn to not expect any answers for pain. Think I ve got to a point of head in the sand self treatment now. Seem to be conflicting attitudes to value of MRI as a friend had for neck probs. I keep looking at barometer hoping it s the reason for pain - perhaps foolish, but when people have conditions for which there is no magic answer or treatment or reasons one becomes complacent I guess. Just wondering whether I should be seeking some answers to this neck problem as it s starting to concern me re<|eot_id|>",

It might be helpful to get an X-ray of your cervical spine to check for any abnormalities or issues like canal stenosis.\n\nContinuing your migraine prophylaxis under the guidance of your healthcare provider is important, as there are many factors that can influence your condition.

If you have started taking Yasmin on days 1-5 of your period, you will be protected against pregnancy immediately.  Since you had an unprotected sex on 4th day after taking pills you seem to be on safer side. However, if you take the pills on the other day of your menstrual cycle, the pills will take at least 7 days to start working so in that case you are at a risk of getting pregnant. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care<|eot_id|>"

Gout occurs when there's too much uric acid in the blood, leading to painful crystal deposits in the joints. 😊 \n\nAllopurinol is indeed a helpful medication that can assist in lowering uric acid levels by increasing its excretion. It's also wise to use NSAIDs for pain and inflammation when needed. Following a low-protein diet can further support your efforts to manage uric acid levels. Regularly checking your uric acid levels and adjusting your allopurinol dosage with your healthcare provider is essential for effective management. \n\nYou're on the right track with your treatment, and it's great that you're taking steps to care for yourself. Keep up the good work, and don't hesitate to reach out to your healthcare professional for guidance! 💙<|eot_id|>",

So allopurinol is the perfect Chat Doctor.  it's will increase the excretion of uric acid. Take NSAIDs as and when required only if plan and inflammation is there. And take low protein containing diet. It will help you to decrease uric acid level. And regularly check uric acid level. And change the dose of allopurinol accordingly.

If you are doubtful about the dates the first trimester ultrasound helps in knowing the EDD. The EDD given in first trimester ultrasound is confirmatory. So both the EDD s from LMP and first trimester ultrasound are same January 7th is your EDD. As you don't have pains you can wait up to 41 weeks if you don't have any complication and your fetal movements are good. So relax. Even after 41 weeks you don't get pains inducing the labor should be done after assessing the pelvis. Nothing to worry. Best regards...<|eot_id|>"

The symptoms that you describe are suggestive offer (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease). Thesesymtoms may be associated with a hiatus hernia. If a part of your stomach slides up and down through the hole in the diaphragm, the muscle that separates the chest and abdomen, that is hiatal hernia. This can get aggravated by heavy lifting, bending, coughing etc. What happens is, there is a sphincter barrier at the junction of the esophagus and stomach that prevents acid from backing up into the esophagus. If the sphincter is weak, then acid can back up and cause pain, heartburn etc. If you are experiencing pain when you eat, Chat Doctor.  You might even have some scarring from acid damage and spasm or narrowing. What you need is to get an x-ray of the esophagus and stomach first to look for any narrowing or big hiatus hernia. If present, then you need an endoscopic evaluation by a specialist to get a direct look and perhaps biopsy to look for problems. As for the history of gallbladder disease in the family, you can get sonogram of the gallbladder as a screening test. There are effective medications to treat HERD which you can discuss with your doctor after the tests I mentioned above. I wish you good luck and good health.<|eot_id|>"

However, Ive had a moderate to severe headache for weeks, frequent dizziness, low urine volumes, fatigue and poor sleep. I dont normally keep track of my BP, idiotic as that may sound. But I saw my doctor last Thursday for these symptoms and my BP was 197/119, pulse 52. He added 5mg of amlodipine to my meds and said to monitor BP for a week. Im doing so every couple hours, but it is staying between 150-186 systolic and 94-110 diastolic, pulse 48-56. Should I consider going to the ER?<|eot_id|>",

It's great that you're considering medication options like Telmisartan or adjusting your Amlodipine dose. 😊 \n\nAdopting a healthy lifestyle is crucial. Focusing on a balanced diet low in fatty, oily, and high-calorie foods, along with reducing salt intake, can make a big difference. Regular monitoring of your blood pressure is also important—aim for three times a day for a week, then once or twice a week after that. \n\nIncorporating at least 30 minutes of exercise, like brisk walking or jogging, five days a week can be very beneficial. Eating plenty of green leafy vegetables, fruits, and fish while avoiding meat, smoking, and alcohol will support your health too. Keeping an eye on abdominal fat and maintaining a healthy weight is essential. \n\nDon't forget to get your lipid profile and blood sugar levels checked as well. Always consult with your healthcare professional for personalized advice. You're taking important steps towards better health, and that's commendable! 💙<|eot_id|>",

Since you are not smoker or not taking alcohol and having age less than 50 years, possibility of esophageal cancer is very, very less. Possibility of bleeding from stomach ulcer is more. You are having gastritis. So if this is worsened than it can cause bleeding. So better to get done repeat upper GIs copy to rule out this.

So let us rule out the possibility of pregnancy; though I feel ultrasonography would have been a better tool to clinch the diagnosis.

After discontinuing the pills, you should get your menses within 4-7 days (if amenorrhea is due to hormonal imbalance). I sincerely feel, ultrasonography may throw some light on your mysterious delay in menses.

In most persons the cysts are not associated with significant problems. Some possible symptoms are fullness or pain. Your doctor may want to remove or take a portion of the wall of the cyst to send it for analysis, it may be of no significance, but they may want to ensure this by lab review. The ultrasound also shows fatty change in the liver which is also of concern because fatty liver is one of the most common causes of liver disease at present. If it is at an early stage a change in diet, increase activity and the use of medications such as statins that are normally used for high cholesterol, may be helpful hope this helps<|eot_id|>"

GGT levels may be increased due to medications also.  Smoking may also cause elevated GGT levels. So, if you have no other investigation suggestive of any diseases, no need to worry. Do not run after a single investigation which is non-specific. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Chat Doctor.  Rammstein, General Surgeon<|eot_id|>"

Also when I lay on my side, mostly left i get a tight crushing feeling that builds up in the middle between my breast and I need to turn back over on my back or sit up. First the doctor thought it was acid reflux and prescribed tablets for this. But, ultimately the sensations didn t really subside and have come back. My doctor took an ecg, said it was normal but that my blood pressure was up. He also examined my breasts because i have had tenderness, soreness and discomfort in my breasts. He said everything felt as it should, no lumps, nothing to indicate breast cancer. He diagnosed that I had hyperkinetic circulation which i have not heard of before. He took blood tests which i will get results for on Monday and prescribed me beta blockers, atenolol actavis 25mg. Ive not taken them before and feel a little nervous to do so?

Sega is a combination of shed skin cells, skin oils, urine, sperm cells and moisture. It occurs in both male and female genital organs. In females, it collects around the clitoris and in males, Sega can collect under the foreskin. There is no evidence that Sega causes penile cancer, but its presence over a long period of time may irritate and inflame the penis, which may increase the risk of cancer. It may also make it harder to see very early cancers. Clean the area beneath your foreskin daily twice after pulling your foreskin back. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.<|eot_id|>"

Since you have mentioned that you have low backache and tingling sensation in your legs it has to be related with nerve compression or due to diabetic neuropathy or lack of nutrients like calamine. This occurs mostly due to our lifestyle habits like usage of computers, watching a lot of TV, bending while reading.1) Do keep a watchful eye about other symptoms like numbness spreading to other parts, blurry vision, loss of sensations over body parts.2) Get your blood sugar tests done and refer the same to your planetologist for further follow through. Mention him about your present problem. 3) You need to keep an erect straight posture of your back and neck.4) Do stretching exercises, when you wake up lie on your chest then using two hand lift yourself up, in an arc like position and then lie down slowly. Repeat his at least ten times daily. This will surely relieve back pain. You can watch online videos for such exercises.5) Take Tablet Neurons once daily, analgesics only if you have severe pain.6) If your problem aggravates you need to get yourself physically examined and investigated through radiological methods like x-ray followed by MRI only if suggested by an orthopedic. Hope these suggestions help you. Contact for further follow up. Thanks with best regards,<|eot_id|>"

It's important to first rule out any obstructive issues in the esophagus, so getting an upper GI (gastrointestinal) endoscopy is a good step. This test can help determine if there's anything blocking your esophagus and also check for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). 😊 \n\nGERD can occur when the gastroesophageal sphincter is weak, allowing stomach acid to flow back into the esophagus, which can cause symptoms like chest pain, tightness, and throat discomfort. To help manage your symptoms, it’s advisable to avoid stress, spicy foods, junk food, and large meals. Instead, try eating smaller, more frequent meals. Medications like proton pump inhibitors and prokinetics can also be beneficial. \n\nRemember, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

I can understand your concern. In my opinion we should first rule out any obstructive lesion in esophagus because you are having problem in swallowing solid food. So get done upper GI (gastrointestinal) copy. If it is normal then possibility of HERD is more. Upper GIs copy will also tell if HERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) is present or not. HERD is due to laxity of gastroesophageal sphincter. Because of this the acid of the stomach tends to come up in the esophagus and cause the symptoms of chest pain, chest tightness, throat pain etc. So we need to treat HERD to relieve your symptoms. So avoid stress and tension. Avoid hot and spicy food. Avoid junk food. Avoid large meals, instead take frequent small meals. Take proton pump inhibitors and prokinetic Chat Doctor.

However, injuries at C4 can indeed affect the trunk and lower limbs, leading to sensory loss in those regions. \n\nIt's great that you're exploring this topic! If you have any more questions or need further clarification, don't hesitate to reach out. Always remember to consult healthcare professionals for personalized advice. 💙<|eot_id|>",

Anyway, I shall answer it. Both a) and b) are true in this case. But not the c. Injury of the spinal cord at C4 level may spare sensations of face and neck as the sensory tracts giving nerves which innervates the dermatomes of face and neck are usually above the level of C4,so these areas usually spared in injury at this level. But the trunk dermatomes innervation are from the spinal segments which are well below this level and injury at this level obviously will transect these tracts and thus will cause sensory loss in trunk region in addition to lower limbs. I hope it helped.<|eot_id|>"
